It is first demonstrated that every quantum cylindric algebra can be converted into a cylindric quasi-implication algebra and conversely that every cylindric quasi-implication algebra gives rise to a quantum cylindric algebra. These constructions are then shown to induce an isomorphism between the category $\\mathbf{CQIA}$ of cylindric quasi-implication algebras and the category $\\mathbf{QCA}$ of quantum cylindric algebras. We then give two alternative constructions of a cylindric orthoframe $X_A$ from a cylindric quasi-implication algebra $A$.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction has emerged as a popular technique for facilitating valid predictive inference across a spectrum of machine learning models, under minimal assumption of exchangeability. Recently, Hoff (2023) showed that full conformal Bayes provides the most efficient prediction sets (smallest by expected volume) among all prediction sets that are valid at the $(1 - \u03b1)$ level if the model is correctly specified. However, a critical issue arises when the Bayesian model itself may be mis-specified, resulting in prediction set that might be suboptimal, even though it still enjoys the frequentist coverage guarantee. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative solution that combines Bayesian model averaging (BMA) with conformal prediction. This hybrid not only leverages the strengths of Bayesian conformal prediction but also introduces a layer of robustness through model averaging. Theoretically, we prove that the resulting prediction set will converge to the optimal level of efficiency, if the true model is included among the candidate models. This assurance of optimality, even under potential model uncertainty, provides a significant improvement over existing methods, ensuring more reliable and precise uncertainty quantification.",

While local well-posedness in $H^1$ is classical, the long-time dynamics in the supercritical regime remains largely unexplored beyond small data global solutions, the construction of multi-solitons for any power and self-similar blow-up near the critical power $p=5$. We develop a unified description of the non-solitonic region for arbitrary $H^1$ solutions, both global and blowing up. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic $L^2$ and $L^p$ dynamics in this region is completely determined by the growth rate of the $L^2$ norm of the gradient (or, equivalently, the critical $H^{s_p}$ norm). In particular, we prove sharp far-field decay on both half-lines and establish normalized local vanishing along sequences of times, with improved estimates in the case of even-power nonlinearities. A key ingredient is a new virial method that compensates for the possible unboundedness of the $H^1$ norm by exploiting the conservation of mass and a careful localization of the nonlinear flux. This yields quantitative versions of decay phenomena previously known only in subcritical settings, and it applies without any smallness or proximity-to-soliton assumptions.",

Standard multigrid fails to converge for the Helmholtz equation, and the well-known complex shifted Laplacian method overcomes it by adding a complex shift and using the shifted system as a preconditioner. However, the added complex shift grows with the frequency and interferes with the preconditioner's scalability. In this work, we present an additive Vanka smoother that requires a much lower shift than point-wise smoothers, and thereby enhances the scalability. By carefully designing different ingredients of the multigrid cycle, the presented method enables deep V-cycles with a small and bounded shift, even when many levels are used. We validate our method theoretically by local Fourier analysis, and hold numerical experiments for homogeneous and heterogeneous media. We show that our method outperforms plain shifted Laplacian in terms of runtimes and performs well on challenging geophysical media in 2D and 3D.",

We show that in the mean-field limit the particle system converges to a novel SDE with reflection at a moving boundary, whose motion is such that the average local time spent at the boundary grows at a constant rate. In general, the boundary is represented by a measure, so the reflection must be interpreted in a relaxed sense.

    "abstract": "The cascade remapping method, originally proposed by Nair et al. (2002) for atmospheric modeling, enables efficient and mass conservative semi Lagrangian (SL) transport through successive one dimensional remapping. While widely used in geophysical flows, its application to plasma kinetics remains limited. To exploit its potential advantages in conservation and scalability, this work applies the conservative cascade semi Lagrangian (CCSL) scheme to the Vlasov equation and related plasma models. A consistency analysis shows that the scheme attains second order spatial accuracy, with the dominant error arising from the geometric approximation of the backtracked region. Moreover, two improvements are introduced: a freestream preserving correction that ensures exact volume conservation, and a maximum principle limiter that suppresses spurious oscillations while maintaining positivity and mass conservation. Numerical tests, including linear advection, guiding center, and relativistic Vlasov Maxwell models, confirm the high accuracy, robustness, and long term stability of the improved CCSL method. Compared with the conservative semi Lagrangian (CSL) and the backward semi Lagrangian (BSL) schemes, it better preserves physical invariants under divergence free conditions, providing a robust and efficient framework for high-fidelity plasma kinetic simulations with good parallel scalability.",

For a rank $r$ Toeplitz matrix ${\\boldsymbol T}\\in {\\mathbb C}^{n\\times n}$ that satisfies a regularity assumption and is corrupted by an arbitrary ${\\boldsymbol E}\\in {\\mathbb C}^{n\\times n}$ such that $\\|{\\boldsymbol E}\\|_2\\leq \u03b1n$, our algorithm outputs a Toeplitz matrix $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol T}$ of rank exactly $r$ such that $\\|{\\boldsymbol T}-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol T}\\|_2 \\leq C \\sqrt r \\, \\|{\\boldsymbol E}\\|_2$, where $C,\u03b1>0$ are absolute constants. This performance guarantee is minimax optimal in $n$ and $\\|{\\boldsymbol E}\\|_2$. We derive optimal results for the second problem as well. Our analysis provides quantitative connections between these two problems and spectral estimation. Our results are equally applicable to Hankel matrices with superficial modifications.",

We consider systems driven by both continuous fluctuations and discrete regime changes, allowing for model misspecification in both the diffusion and switching components. Within a unified framework, we study four classical cost formulations finite horizon, infinite-horizon discounted and ergodic costs, and the exit time cost, and establish continuity of value functions and robustness of optimal controls. Specifically, we show that as a sequence of approximating regime switching models converges to the true model, the associated value functions and optimal policies converge as well, ensuring vanishing performance loss. The analysis relies on the regularity of the solution to the associated weakly coupled HJB systems, and their stochastic representation.

    "abstract": "Consider nonparametric domain adaptation for regression, which assumes the same conditional distribution of the response given the covariates but different marginal distributions of the covariates. An important goal is to understand how the source data may improve the minimax convergence rate of learning the regression function when the likelihood ratio of the covariate marginal distributions of the target data and the source data are unbounded. A previous work of Pathak et al. (2022) show that the minimax transfer learning rate is simply determined by the faster rate of using either the source or the target data alone. In this paper, we present a new synergistic learning phenomenon (SLP) that the minimax convergence rate based on both data may sometimes be faster (even much faster) than the better rate of convergence based on the source or target data only. The SLP occurs when and only when the target sample size is smaller (in order) than but not too much smaller than the source sample size in relation to the smoothness of the regression function and the nature of the covariate densities of the source and target distributions. Interestingly, the SLP happens in two different ways according to the relationship between the two sample sizes. One is that the target data help alleviate the difficulty in estimating the regression function at points where the density of the source data is close to zero and the other is that the source data (with its larger sample size than that of the target data) help the estimation at points where the density of the source data is not small. Extensions to handle unknown source and target parameters and smoothness of the regression function are also obtained.",

At the core of these results lies a new unique continuation property for the nonlinear plate equation, which significantly relaxes the geometric conditions required for such property to hold. This property is obtained by combining recent results on propagation of analyticity in time and unique continuation for linear plate operators. More broadly, our approach exploits the linear observability of the plate equation to establish both stabilization and control results. First, we prove exponential decay of the nonlinear energy under a defocusing assumption on the nonlinearity.

Our theoretical results cover both parametric and nonparametric estimation of the marginal distributions, as well as truncated vines, and are also applicable to general estimation problems, particularly other sequential procedures. Numerical experiments suggest that the derived assumptions are satisfied if the pair copulas in higher trees converge to independence copulas sufficiently fast. A simulation study substantiates these findings and identifies settings in which estimation becomes challenging. In particular, the vine structure strongly affects estimation accuracy, with D-vines being more difficult to estimate than C-vines, and estimates in Gumbel vines exhibit substantially larger biases than those in Gaussian vines.",

Building on the prior work establishing this uniqueness, we develop a quantitative stability theory that characterizes how approximate linearity of the optimal estimator constrains the prior distribution. For $L^2$ loss, we derive explicit rates showing that near-linearity of the conditional mean implies proximity of the prior to the Gaussian in the L\u00e9vy metric.

Second, instead of testing whether the coordinates are pairwise independent, we are interested in determining whether certain pairwise associations between the components (such as all pairwise Kendall's $\u03c4$ coefficients) do not exceed a given threshold in absolute value. Considering hypotheses of this form is motivated by the observation that in the high-dimensional regime, it is rare and perhaps impossible to have a null hypothesis that can be modeled exactly by assuming that all pairwise associations are precisely equal to zero.\n  The formulation of the null hypothesis as a composite hypothesis makes the problem of constructing tests already non-standard in the non-private setting. Additionally, under privacy constraints, state of the art procedures rely on permutation approaches that are rendered invalid under a composite null. We propose a novel bootstrap based methodology that is especially powerful in sparse settings, develop theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and show that the proposed method enjoys good finite sample properties even in the high privacy regime.

Although GLADMM achieves the same total convergence rate of $O(\\frac{1}{N})$ as in existing results, the partial convergence rate is improved from $O(\\frac{1}{N^{3/2}})$ to $O(\\frac{1}{N^2})$. To validate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we conduct numerical experiments on various problem instances, including the $\\ell_1$ regularized logistic regression, quadratic programming, and compressive sensing. The experimental results indicate that our algorithms outperform existing methods in terms of efficiency. This also demonstrates the potential of the stochastic algorithmic versions of these algorithms in application areas such as statistics, machine learning, and data mining. Finally, it is worth noting that this paper aims to introduce how G\u00fcler's acceleration technique can be applied to gradient-based algorithms and to provide a unified and concise framework for their construction.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the well-posedness theory of F. John's problem for freely floating objects in a two-dimensional framework. This problem is a linear description of the interactions between an incompressible, irrotational free-surface fluid and a partially immersed solid object. It is related to the Cummins equations, which are a set of coupled integro-differential equations widely used by naval engineers. Our results provide a rigorous justification of this model and the first proof of its well-posedness. To this end, we show that F. John's problem has a Hamiltonian structure, albeit with a non-definite Hamiltonian which compels us to work in a semi-Hilbertian framework. The presence of corners in the fluid domain also induces a lack of elliptic regularity for the boundary value problem satisfied by the velocity potential. This is why the solution to F. John's problem has in general a limited regularity, even with very smooth initial data. Correspondingly, the solution to Cummins' equation is in general no better than $C^3$. We demonstrate higher regularity when the contact angles are small or equal to $\u03c0/2$, provided that some compatibility conditions, propagated by the flow, are satisfied. This allows us to exhibit qualitative differences between the three degrees of freedom of the object. For instance, the motion of an object allowed to move only vertically can be $C^\\infty$, while it cannot be better than $C^3$ if it is only allowed to translate horizontally.",

    "abstract": "Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged as a revolutionary technology offering enhanced spatial diversity within a compact form factor. Concurrently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are integral to future networks, necessitating channel models that capture both multipath fading and shadowing. This letter presents a novel performance analysis of a UAV-to-ground link, where the receiver is equipped with an $N$-port FAS operating over the challenging double-shadowing fading channel. By adapting a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation for the correlated FAS ports, we derive new analytical expressions for the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio statistics, namely the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function. Based on these statistics, we present exact integral expressions for the outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel capacity. We further derive new, tractable closed-form solutions for the average bit error rate and capacity for the practical dual-rank, independent but non-identically distributed case. Finally, a key asymptotic analysis reveals that the system achieves a multiplicative diversity order of $G_d = M \\times d$, which is precisely the product of the FAS spatial rank $M$ and the intrinsic channel diversity order $d$. Simulation results are provided to validate the high accuracy of our entire theoretical framework.",

Using Wedderburn's polynomials, this permits us to define a length function on PE$(2,R)$, which suggests a stable range type condition (for $n =1$, it {\\it is\\/} stable range one, but higher values do not correspond.\n  Again using the length results, we prove the expected results for PE$(2,R)$: under very modest conditions on $R$, the commutator subgroup of PE$(2,R)$ is perfect and of index one or two.\n  Along the same lines, we also prove results on simplicity of the commutator subgroup: we require the usual generative properties on the simple ring $R$, as well either the very restrictive $1$ in the range, or a mild condition about invertibles, involving intersections of three translates of GL$(1,R)$.

First, we provide new, first-order approximations of the pulse speed and width.

This problem is closely related to the famous Erd\u0151s--Rado sunflower problem of determining the size $\u03c6(s,t)$ of the largest $t$-uniform family with no $s$-sunflower. In this paper, we answer this question exactly for $t=2$, odd $s$ and $k\\ge 5$, provided $n$ is large enough. Previously, the only know exact extremal result on this problem was due to Chung and Frankl from 1987.\n  One of the important ingredients for the proof that we obtained is a stability result for the Duke--Erd\u0151s problem, which was previously not known, mostly due to our lack of understanding of the behaviour of $\u03c6(s,t)$.\n  For large $k$ and $n$ we in fact manage to reduce the Duke--Erd\u0151s problem to an Erd\u0151s--Rado-like problem which depends on $t$ and $s$ only. In particular, we get a good understanding of the structure of extremal families for the Duke--Erd\u0151s problem in terms of the Erd\u0151s--Rado problem. Previously, a much looser variant of this connection (only in terms of the sizes, rather than the structure, of respective extremal families) was established in a seminal work of Frankl and F\u00fcredi from 1987.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the stability and bifurcation of the two-dimensional viscous primitive equations with full diffusion under thermal forcing. The system governs perturbations about a motionless basic state with a linear temperature profile in a periodic channel, where the temperature is fixed at $T_0$ and $T_1$ on the bottom and upper boundaries, respectively. Through a rigorous analysis of three distinct thermal regimes, we identify a critical temperature difference $T_c$ that fundamentally dictates the system's dynamical transitions. Our main contributions are fourfold. Firstly, in the subcritical case $T_0 - T_1 < T_c$, we use energy methods to establish the global nonlinear stability in $H^2$-norm, proving that perturbations decay exponentially. Secondly, precisely at the critical threshold $T_0 - T_1 = T_c$, we prove not only the nonlinear stability in $H^1$-norm but also the asymptotic convergence of all solutions to zero, leveraging spectral and dynamical systems theory. Finally, in the supercritical regime $T_0 - T_1 > T_c$, a bootstrap argument reveals that the basic state is nonlinearly unstable across all $L^p$-norms for $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$. Finally, near the critical point, the dynamics are first reduced to a two-dimensional system on a center manifold. This reduced system then undergoes a supercritical bifurcation, generating a countable family of stable steady states that are organized into a local ring attractor. This work closes a significant gap in the stability analysis of the thermally driven primitive equations, establishing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the formation of convection cells in large-scale geophysical flows.",

    "abstract": "The study presents a vector-valued extension of the classical Mercer theorem within the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined over Kaplansky-Hilbert modules associated with the algebra of essentially bounded measurable functions. The analysis focuses on a partial integral operator with a positive definite kernel depending on a measurable parameter, and establishes the equivalence of three fundamental properties: the completeness of the system of eigenfunctions in the corresponding vector-valued space, the injectivity of the adjoint embedding operator, and the existence of a pointwise spectral decomposition of the kernel in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a parameterized family of operators. The proof relies on constructing an isometric isomorphism between the Kaplansky-Hilbert module and the space of measurable sections of a Hilbert bundle, thereby reducing the problem to the application of the classical Mercer theorem on each fiber of the bundle. Furthermore, a formalism of vector-valued lifting is developed to guarantee the coherence of inner product structures between the original module and its bundle representation.",

Such flows arise naturally in the theory of biharmonic maps and geometric variational problems involving bending energy. We first establish the global existence of smooth solutions to the associated initial value problem, assuming appropriate conditions on the forcing term. The analysis is performed through a reformulation of the geometric flow using the support function, enabling a scalar PDE characterization of the evolution. Under specific geometric constraints, we demonstrate that the governing equation admits a Monge Amp\u00e9re type structure that can exhibit hyperbolic behavior. Furthermore, we prove that convexity is preserved during the evolution and derive sufficient conditions ensuring long time convergence to steady-state solutions. Our results extend recent developments in geometric analysis by clarifying the role of forcing terms in stabilizing high order curvature flows and enhancing their qualitative behavior.",

    "abstract": "We present a hybrid method for time-dependent particle transport that combines Monte Carlo (MC) estimation with a deterministic discrete ordinates (\\(S_N\\)) solve, augmented by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling. For spatial discretizations, the MC component computes a piecewise-constant (cell-averaged) solution, while the \\(S_N\\) stage employs bilinear discontinuous finite elements. By hybridizing the formulation, the MC subproblem after a prescribed scatter limit becomes scattering-free, yielding a simple and efficient streaming/attenuation procedure. Between time steps, a simple scatter-free MC step is run to relabel the $S_N$ solution as an MC solution.\n  A key feature of the approach is a tunable parameter \\(N_{s}\\) that controls how many material collisions are handled in the (Q)MC leg before handing off to the deterministic \\(S_N\\) solve; \\(N_s=0\\) recovers a purely uncollided MC leg, while \\(N_s>0\\) produces multi-scatter hybrids. QMC replaces pseudorandom draws with low-discrepancy points in the existing MC sampling maps, enabling a plug-in adoption within the standard MC code with modest, localized changes.\n  We observe significant accuracy and convergence rate improvements through the use of QMC and practically no additional computational cost, which are generally not seen in comparable non-hybrid solves. We believe the multi-scatter approach provides additional flexibility in terms of parallelization and the choice of deterministic solver.",

    "title": "Efficient Penalty-Based Bilevel Methods: Improved Analysis, Novel Updates, and Flatness Condition",
    "abstract": "Penalty-based methods have become popular for solving bilevel optimization (BLO) problems, thanks to their effective first-order nature. However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the \"flatness\" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.",

The coefficients of the power series were provided as a sum of products of three hyperbolic functions that are analogous to the familiar commutator expansion. We find a new form of the power series coefficients that is a linear combination of just one of the hyperbolic functions. This linear combination can be understood through elementary permutations of the arguments of the hyperbolic function. We use generating functions and hyperbolic identities to relate the representations. The permutation representation is radically different to previously known structures in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula and naturally supersedes the previous power series representation for future use, in our opinion. It also allows us to prove a set of intriguing marching identities that are useful in physical applications and were discovered in the initial work.",

We present a new mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation, and develop an efficient linear programming (LP) based branch-and-cut (B&C) algorithm where submodular and outer-approximation inequalities are used to replace the nonlinear constraints and are separated at the nodes of the search tree. One key advantage of the proposed B&C algorithm is that the number of variables in the underlying formulation grows only linearly with the number of customers and facility locations and is one-order of magnitude smaller than that in the underlying formulation of a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in the literature. Moreover, we propose two new families of strong valid inequalities, called enhanced outer-approximation and lifted subadditive inequalities, to strengthen the LP relaxation and speed up the convergence of the proposed B&C algorithm. In extensive computational experiments on a testbed of 240 benchmark MPCLP instances, we show that, thanks to the small problem size and the strong LP relaxation of the underlying formulation, the proposed B&C algorithm significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art B&C algorithm in terms of running time, number of nodes in the search tree, and number of solved instances.

    "abstract": "Contextual stochastic optimization is an advanced methodology to model uncertainty in the presence of contextual information during decision planning processes. Although classical methodologies focus on minimizing the expectation of a random loss, in many applications, risk-averse decision-makers may be interested in minimizing a specific quantile as a more prudent alternative. In this paper, we propose a new risk-averse contextual stochastic optimization problem with a quantile objective for general two-stage problems. Given historical data on the model's random parameters and contextual information, we model the conditional quantile by replacing the conditional expectation in its variational characterization with a generic estimator. Under two sets of mild regularity conditions, we derive the asymptotic almost-sure convergence and convergence in probability of the optimal solution and the optimal value of the associated optimization problem to their true counterparts. Optimization problems with a quantile objective is usually non-convex, which are generally regarded as challenging to solve. To address the computational difficulties, we propose a new stochastic inexact constraint generation method with convergence guarantee. Finally, through numerical experiments on a single-server appointment scheduling problem, we study the computational performance of our proposed solution method as well as operational performance of our proposed methodology. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating useful contextual information and decision-maker's risk attitude into the optimization model.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper local derivations and local automorphisms of five-dimensional naturally graded nilpotent associative algebras are studied. Namely, a general form of the matrices of local derivations and local automorphisms of algebras $\u03c0_2$ and $\u03c0_3$ is clarified. It turns out that the general form of the matrix of an automorphism (derivation) on these algebras does not coincide with the local automorphism's (resp. local derivation's) matrix's general form on these algebras. Therefore, these associative algebras have local automorphisms (resp. local derivations) that are not automorphisms (resp. derivations). We also establish a relationship between local automorphisms and local derivations via an exponential expression. We prove that the sets of local derivations of algebras $\u03c0_2$ and $\u03c0_3$ form Lie algebras with respect to the Lie brackets. Thus, we show that the Lie algebra problem from the Ayupov-Eldique-Kudaybergenov problems for local derivations of the algebras under consideration has a positive solution. The other problems from the Ayupov-Eldique-Kudaybergenov problems have a positive (negative) solution for algebra $\u03c0_2$ (resp. algebra $\u03c0_3$)",

This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift.",

We prove a weaker, but numerically explicit version of this theorem, showing that for $m\\ge 6.52\\times10^9$ there is a prime $p\\in(m^2,2m^2)$ with $m/p$ not the sum of 3 unit fractions, and report on some extensive numerical calculations that support this assertion with the much smaller bound $m\\ge19$.

In this paper, we consider the Berezin-Toeplitz deformation quantization and obtain the following global results concerning the asymptotic action of Berezin-Toeplitz operators on $H^0(X, L^{\\otimes k})$:\n  (1). For a general smooth function $f \\in C^\\infty(X)$, we prove that the Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are asymptotic to differential operators acting on $H^0(X, L^{\\otimes k})$ as $k \\to \\infty$. An immediate consequence is their asymptotic locality.\n  (2). If $f \\in C^\\infty(X)$ is furthermore the symbol of a level $k$ quantizable function, then we prove that the associated Berezin-Toeplitz operators $T_{f,k}$ are all holomorphic differential operators. Conversely, Berezin-Toeplitz operators that are holomorphic differential operators all arise in this way. This gives a complete characterization of when Berezin-Toeplitz operators are holomorphic differential operators.\n  To prove these results, we construct higher order analgoues of Kostant-Souriau's pre-quantum differential operators using our Fedosov-type constructions in previous works, establish new orthogonality relations which generalize the classical Tuynman's Lemma, and employ various differential-geometric and analytic technqiues such as H\u00f6rmander's estimates.",

The largest class of graphs for which this was previously known was established by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov in 1999, who proved it for the so-called almost bipartite graphs, namely subgraphs of $K_{1,t,t}$.\n  We prove the conjecture for all 3-colorable graphs $F$, i.e., subgraphs of $K_{t,t,t}$, representing the first progress on the problem in more than 25 years. More precisely, we show that every $n$-vertex $K_{t,t,t}$-free graph of average degree $d$ contains an independent set of size at least $(1 - o(1)) n \\log d / d$, matching Shearer's celebrated bound for triangle-free graphs (the case $t = 1$) and thereby yielding a substantial strengthening of it. Our proof combines a new variant of the R\u00f6dl nibble method for constructing independent sets with a Tur\u00e1n-type result on $K_{t,t,t}$-free graphs.\n  A closely related conjecture of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov (1999) asserts that any $F$-free graph of maximum degree at most $\u0394$ has chromatic number $O(\u0394/ \\log \u0394)$. This was previously known only for almost bipartite graphs (verified by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov themselves), while most recent results were concerned with improving the leading constant factor in the case where $F$ is almost bipartite.
