    "title": "Implicit-explicit schemes for compressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations on staggered grids",
    "abstract": "We propose a second-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) time-stepping scheme for the isentropic, compressible Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations discretized on staggered (MAC) grids. The scheme is based on finite difference approximations that ensure a stable coupling among the velocity, density and phase field, with symmetric operators acting on the discretized viscosity terms.\n  Standard explicit methods suffer from severe time-step restrictions due to the presence of second to fourth-order diffusion terms introduced by the Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes operators. To overcome these challenges, we develop an IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme that treats the stiff terms implicitly while the convective terms are dealt with explicitly, with the advantage that only linear systems are solved at each stage.\n  Numerical experiments are performed to verify the stability, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

    "title": "Up-down chains and scaling limits: application to permuton- and graphon-valued diffusions",
    "abstract": "An up-down chain is a Markov chain in which each transition is a two-step process that moves up to a larger object and then back down to an object of the original size. The first goal of this paper is to present a general framework for analyzing these chains and computing their scaling limits. This approach unifies much of the existing literature while extending it in several directions. These include explicit conditions for constructing integrable up-down chains and convergence results for families of intertwined processes. The latter contribute to the method of intertwiners of Borodin and Olshanski.\n  The second goal is to highlight a notable application of this framework to the settings of permutations and graphs. Here, we identify some integrable up-down chains and construct their scaling limits, a family of permuton- and graphon-valued Feller diffusions. Both the up-down chains and the limiting diffusions exhibit ergodicity, diagonalizable semigroups, and explicit expressions for the maximal separation distance to stationarity. For the diffusions, the stationary measures are the recursive separable permutons and recursive cographons recently introduced by the authors, and the separation distances turn out to be related to the Dedekind eta function.",

    "title": "Characterizations of quasihyperbolic John domains and uniform domains in metric spaces",
    "abstract": "In a recent work of Zhou and Ponnusamy [Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Ci. Sci. 2025], the authors studied the following natural question: find sufficient and necessary conditions for a domain $\u03a9$ in a metric space $X$ to be quasihyperbolic John. It was proved that Gromov hyperbolic John domains are quasihyperbolic John, quantitatively. As an application, they obtained a characterization of uniform domains in Ahlfors regular spaces.\n  In a recent work, using a deep improved characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity, Guo, Huang and Wang [arXiv 2025] proved the quantitative equivalence bteween inner uniformity and the quasihyperbolic John condition in metric doubling spaces. However, the proof does not yield a similar characterization for uniform domains. In this article, we find a new elementary approach to successfully extend the above characterization to uniform domains: a domain $\u03a9$ in a doubling length space $X$ is uniform if and only if it is linearly locally connected (LLC) and satisfies the ball separation condition, if and only if it is LLC-1 and quasihyperbolic John, quantitatively. This substantially improved the corresponding results of Zhou and Ponnusamy. Our new approach also allows us to give an alternative proof of the inner uniformity result of Guo-Huang-Wang without using the improved characterization on Gromov hyperbolicity.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel approach for designing high-order energy-decaying schemes for Maxwell's equations in Havriliak-Negami dispersive media. It is shown that conventional convolution quadrature (CQ) methods, which rely directly on the generating function of linear multistep methods, cannot generate completely monotonic sequences beyond first-order accuracy. We rigorously prove that for any linear multistep method of second-or higher-order, the associated generating function $\u03b4(\u03b6)$ cannot satisfy both that \\(-\u03b4(\u03b6)\\) is a Pick function and that it is analytic on \\((-\\infty,1)\\) - a key requirement for constructing completely monotonic sequences. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we introduce a reconstruction of the generating function's structure. By strategically incorporating the theory of Pick functions, we successfully construct a second-order completely monotonic sequence. This theoretical advance leads to a discrete scheme that inherits the continuous model's energy decay property, guaranteeing unconditional stability. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence rates and energy dissipation behavior of the proposed method.",

    "title": "Learned Digital Codes for Over-the-Air Computation in Federated Edge Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables wireless devices to collaboratively train a centralised model without sharing raw data, but repeated uplink transmission of model updates makes communication the dominant bottleneck. Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL.",

When a wind turbine harvests energy from free wind, it produces a turbulent region with reduced energy for downstream turbines. Strategies for increasing the efficiency of wind farms by mitigating wake effects have been the subject of much computational research. To this end, both the positioning of the turbines and their cooperative control must be taken into account. Since they are mutually dependent, increasing attention has been paid to the joint consideration of layout design and control. However, joint modeling approaches lead to large-scale and difficult optimization problems, which lack efficient solution strategies. This paper describes an efficient optimization framework for the joint design and steady-state control of wind turbines under a continuous wake effect model. Through a multi-level reformulation of the joint optimization problem, it shows how problem sub-structure can be efficiently exploited to yield order-of-magnitude reduction in convergence times over naive approaches and prior proposals.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity spectrum cartography is pivotal for spectrum management and wireless situational awareness, yet it remains a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the sparsity and irregularity of observations. Furthermore, existing approaches often decouple reconstruction from sensing, lacking a principled mechanism for informative sampling. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that jointly addresses spectrum reconstruction and active sensing. We formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional generation process driven by a learned diffusion prior. Specifically, we derive tractable, closed-form posterior transition kernels for the reverse diffusion process, which enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of diffusion models, we further develop an uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy. This strategy quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to adaptively guide sensing agents toward the most informative locations, thereby maximizing spectral efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization.",

We apply DEN to the parametric non-selfadjoint Steklov eigenvalue problem and provide theoretical proofs for the Lipschitz continuity of the eigensubspace with respect to the parameters. In addition, we derive error bounds for the reconstruction of the eigenspace. Numerical experiments validate DEN's high accuracy and zero-shot generalization capabilities across different discretizations.",

    "abstract": "We introduce two nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction methods for regressions with tensor-valued predictors. Our goal is two-fold: the first is to preserve the tensor structure when performing dimension reduction, particularly the meaning of the tensor modes, for improved interpretation; the second is to substantially reduce the number of parameters in dimension reduction, thereby achieving model parsimony and enhancing estimation accuracy. Our two tensor dimension reduction methods echo the two commonly used tensor decomposition mechanisms: one is the Tucker decomposition, which reduces a larger tensor to a smaller one; the other is the CP-decomposition, which represents an arbitrary tensor as a sequence of rank-one tensors. We developed the Fisher consistency of our methods at the population level and established their consistency and convergence rates. Both methods are easy to implement numerically: the Tucker-form can be implemented through a sequence of least-squares steps, and the CP-form can be implemented through a sequence of singular value decompositions. We investigated the finite-sample performance of our methods and showed substantial improvement in accuracy over existing methods in simulations and two data applications.",

Appl., 40 (2019), pp. 1206--1231], which unifies several well-studied tensor eigenvalue and singular value problems. First, we propose an alternative min-max Collatz--Wielandt formula for the $(\\boldsymbol\u03c3,\\mathbf{p})$-spectral radius, which bypasses the auxiliary multihomogeneous mapping employed in that work. This variational characterization both recovers several classical results and admits a natural convex reformulation. It arises from an alternative approach that directly connects the $(\\boldsymbol\u03c3,\\mathbf{p})$-spectral problem to a class of convex programs.\n  We then develop and analyze a line search Newton-Noda method (LS-NNM) for computing the positive $(\\boldsymbol\u03c3,\\mathbf{p})$-eigenpair of nonnegative tensors. The proposed method integrates Newton method with Noda iteration. The Newton equation is derived from an equivalent nonlinear system, while the eigenvalue sequence is updated by the strategy of the Noda iteration and its variants. To ensure global convergence, we introduce a positivity-preserving line search procedure based on an equivalent constrained optimization problem. The global and quadratic convergence of LS-NNM are established for the class of $(\\boldsymbol\u03c3,\\mathbf{p})$-spectral problem that admits a unique positive $(\\boldsymbol\u03c3,\\mathbf{p})$-eigenpair, as guaranteed by the Perron-Frobenius theorem.

    "abstract": "Designing materials that can effectively and repeatedly absorb energy from unpredictable directions represents a grand challenge in modern engineering, crucial for applications from vehicle crashworthiness systems to personal protective equipment. While bistable structures offer a promising pathway towards reusable energy absorbers, their functionality is almost universally constrained to a single loading axis, rendering them vulnerable and ineffective against off axis or oblique impacts. Here, we report the discovery and harnessing of eversion buckling, a distinct pitchfork bifurcation phenomenon in axisymmetric shells, to overcome this fundamental limitation. By strategically designing shell geometries to leverage this mechanism, we have engineered structural units with robust, inplane omnidirectional bistability. This property is characterized by a massive and rapid volumetric contraction upon snapping, which is key to its exceptional performance. When assembled, these structures exhibit an ideal, extended stress plateau, leading to a near perfect energy absorption efficiency dramatically outperforming typical energy absorbing materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the system's damping capacity far exceeds its constituent material, and highly tunable, spanning a sixfold range of loss factors which enables load adaptive properties. This design strategy, elucidates a clear mechanism rooted in enhanced friction and sequential stress release, paving the way for a new class of robust, reusable, and load adaptive energy absorbing systems.",

The closures for the hybrid LOSM equations are calculated by the MC method. The LOSM equations are discretized by a scheme of the second-order accuracy in time and space. Filtering techniques are applied to reduce noise effects in the LOSM closures. The WWs defined with the auxiliary solution give rise to sufficiently uniform MC particle distribution in space on each time step. The algorithm is analyzed by means of an analytic transport benchmark. We study performance of the MC algorithm depending on a set parameters of WWs.

One important property any such generalization should fulfill is consistency with the classical formulation for a class of spacetimes as large as possible. The purpose of this note is to show that the recent reformulation of the NEC by McCann as variable lower timelike Ricci curvature bounds (arXiv:2304.14341) remains equivalent to the classical NEC not just for smooth but even for $C^2$-metrics, where McCann's original proof needs to be modified.",

Rigorous a posteriori estimators exist for the global energy-norm error introduced by geometry simplifications. However, practitioners are usually more concerned with the accuracy of specific quantities of interest (QoIs) in the solution. This paper bridges that gap by developing mathematically certified, goal-oriented a posteriori defeaturing error estimators for Poisson's equation, linear elasticity, and Stokes flow. First, we derive new reliable energy-norm estimators for features subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions in linear elasticity and Stokes flow, based on existing results for Poisson's equation. Second, we formulate general energy-norm estimators for multiple negative features, subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for the first time. Finally, we combine these estimators with the dual-weighted residual (DWR) method to obtain reliable estimates for linear QoIs and demonstrate their effectiveness across a range of numerical experiments.",

Our main results characterize the limiting distributions under appropriate rescaling. The resulting one-dimensional marginals may be half-normal, Rayleigh, geometric, negative binomial, or certain mixtures thereof. In most situations, the coordinates are asymptotically independent; however, there are notable exceptions for the meander case, depending on the drift. The proofs rely on conditioning on the numbers of horizontal and vertical steps, which restores a form of independence and reduces the problem to one-dimensional estimates via binomial convolution and Bernstein-type approximations.",

Most sparse generators control at most two of these features, and assortativity is often achieved by degree-preserving rewiring, which obscures the mechanism-parameter link. We introduce CoLaS (copula-seeded local latent-space graphs), a modular latent-variable model that separates marginal specifications from dependence. Each node has a popularity variable governing degree heterogeneity and a latent geometric location governing locality. A low-dimensional copula couples popularity and location, providing an interpretable dependence parameter that tunes degree mixing while leaving the chosen marginals unchanged. Under shrinking-range locality, edges are conditionally independent, the graph remains sparse, and clustering does not vanish. We develop sparse-limit theory for degrees, transitivity, and assortativity. Degrees converge to mixed-Poisson limits and we establish a degree-tail dichotomy: with fixed-range local kernels, degree tails are necessarily light, even under heavy-ailed popularity. To recover power-law degrees without sacrificing sparsity or locality, we propose CoLaS-HT, a minimal tail-inheriting extension in which effective connection ranges grow with popularity. Finally, under an identifiability condition, we provide a consistent one-graph calibration method based on jointly matching transitivity and assortativity.",

The packing number of CISSTs, denoted by $\u03ba^*_G(S),$ is the maximum number of CISSTs in $G.$ The generalized $k^*$-connectivity $\u03ba_k^*(G)$ is the minimum $\u03ba_G^*(S)$ for $S$ ranges over all $k$-subsets of $V(G).$ We provide a detailed characterization of CISSTs. Also, we investigate the CISSTs of complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we determine the generalized $k^*$-connectivity for complete graphs and give a tight lower bound of the generalized $k^*$-connectivity for complete bipartite graphs.",

    "abstract": "The construction of robust solvers for linear systems obtained from the discretization of partial differential equations using Isogeometric Analysis is challenging since the condition number of the system matrix not only grows with the reciprocal square of the grid size (for second order problems), but also exponentially with the spline degree. The Fast Diagonalization method allows the construction of a preconditioner that is robust both in grid size and spline degree. Although this method is efficient in practice, its computational complexity is superlinear in the number of degrees of freedom. In this work, we construct a variant of the Fast Diagonalization method that can exploit the Fast Fourier Transformation. Note that, because of boundary effects, a Fourier Transformation cannot diagonalize the overall problem. We circumvent this issue using a stable splitting of the spline space. The resulting preconditioner is still robust with respect to the grid size and spline degree and can be realized with a computational complexity that grows almost linearly with the number of degrees of freedom.",

Both a manifold in Euclidean space and a function defined on this manifold can be viewed as bounded linear functionals on a suitable space of continuous functions. From this perspective, we treat manifold functions as elements of the dual space. By expanding them in the dual space based on appropriate approximating sequence of bases, we obtain a corresponding method for encoding manifold functions, that is MFE. Especially, we prove that MFE achieves super-algebraic convergence based on smooth bases commonly used in spectral methods, such as Legendre polynomials and Fourier basis. We further extend MFE to handle more complex cases, including joint manifold functions of different dimensions and manifold functions with different measures. In addition, we show the approximation theory for MFE-based operator learning, in particular learning the solution mappings of PDEs defined on varying domains, together with several numerical experiments including the 2-d Poisson equation and the 3-d elasticity problem on the real-world bearing.",

    "abstract": "Many engineering tasks require solving families of nonlinear constrained optimization problems, parametrized in setting-specific variables. This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization.",

The different flavours (even or odd) of complexes appear as forms of Koszul complexes; the Koszul property of the linear category provides an elegant homological interpretation of their homology.\n  This approach allows a second form of Koszul complex to enter the picture. For the `even' flavour, this corresponds to a precursor of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the Conant-Vogtmann Lie algebra associated to a cyclic operad and a symplectic vector space (generalizing Kontsevich's Lie algebras). Again, the cohomology of the Koszul complex has an elegant interpretation.\n  This sheds light on the relationship between the unstable case and Kontsevich's identification (generalized by Conant and Vogtmann) of the homology in the infinite-dimensional case with a form of graph homology (in the even case).

    "abstract": "High-mobility wireless communication systems suffer from severe Doppler spread and multi-path delay, which degrade the reliability and spectral efficiency of conventional modulation schemes. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers strong robustness in such environments by representing symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, while faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can further enhance spectral efficiency through intentional symbol packing. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide a promising means to improve link quality via passive beamforming. Motivated by these advantages, we propose a novel RIS-empowered OTFS modulation with FTN signaling (RIS-OTFS-FTN) scheme. First, we establish a unified DD-domain input-output relationship that jointly accounts for RIS passive beamforming, FTN-induced inter-symbol interference, and DD-domain channel characteristics. Based on this model, we provide comprehensive analytical performance for the frame error rate, spectral efficiency, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), etc. Furthermore, a practical RIS phase adjustment strategy with quantized phase selection is designed to maximize the effective channel gain. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations under a standardized extended vehicular A (EVA) channel model validate the theoretical results and provide key insights into the trade-offs among spectral efficiency, PAPR, input back-off (IBO), and error performance, with some interesting insights.The proposed RIS-OTFS-FTN scheme demonstrates notable performance gains in both reliability and spectral efficiency, offering a viable solution for future high-mobility and spectrum-constrained wireless systems.",

We demonstrate that this trichotomy has a natural explanation in the representation theory of SO(3). Sectoral harmonics correspond to highest-weight vectors annihilated by the raising operator $L_+$; this annihilation condition reduces to a first-order differential equation admitting solutions for any real $m > 0$, independent of representation-theoretic constraints. Tesseral harmonics arise from the full ladder algebra acting on highest-weight states; for non-integer $m$, this construction yields tesseral modes at $\u03bd= m + k$ for positive integer $k$, with the hypergeometric series terminating when $\u03bd- m$ is a non-negative integer. Zonal harmonics with $m = 0$ require integer $\u03bd$ on the full sphere, but TE-polarised zonal modes survive in wedge geometries because their electric field components automatically satisfy the conducting boundary conditions. Numerical simulations of electromagnetic cavities with conducting wedges confirm these predictions quantitatively: both sectoral modes ($\u03bd= m$) and tesseral modes ($\u03bd= m + k$) are observed with sub-percent frequency agreement, validating the extended framework for non-integer azimuthal index.",

We formulate the problem using the steady Boltzmann equation in polar coordinates and seek a solution invariant under rotation. We assume that the steady state has the specific form $F(r,v_{r},v_\u03c6-\u03b1\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}},v_{z})$, where the translation angular velocity $\u03b1\\frac{r-r_{1}}{1-r_{1}}$ is linearly sheared along the radial direction. With this ansatz, the problem is reduced to solve the nonlinear steady Boltzmann equation with geometric correction, subject to an external shear force of strength $\u03b1$ and the homogeneous non-moving diffuse reflection boundary condition. We establish the existence of a non-equilibrium steady solution for any small enough shear rate $\u03b1$ through Caflisch's decomposition, complemented by careful uniform estimates based on Guo's $L^{\\infty} \\cap L^2$ framework. The steady profile displays a polynomial tail behavior at large velocities. For the proof, we develop a delicate double-parameter $(\u03b5,\u03c3)$-approximation argument for the construction of solutions. In particular, we obtain uniform macroscopic dissipation estimates in the absence of mass conservation for $\u03c3\\in [0,1)$ getting close to 1. Additionally, due to the non-trivial geometric effects, we develop subtle constructions of test functions by solving second-order ODEs with geometric corrections to establish macroscopic dissipation. Furthermore, we justify the non-negativity of the steady profile by demonstrating its large-time asymptotic stability with an exponential convergence rate under radial perturbations.",

    "title": "Deconvolution with parametric rate of convergence in unlinked linear models",
    "abstract": "Unlinked regression, in which covariates and responses are observed separately without known correspondence, has recently gained increasing attention. Deconvolution, on the other hand, is a fundamental and challenging problem in nonparametric statistics with the aim of estimating the distribution of a latent random variable $Z$ based on observations contaminated by some additive noise. The complexity of this task is heavily influenced by the smoothness of the noise distribution and often leads to slow estimation rates. In this paper, we combine the recent unlinked linear regression problem with the classical deconvolution framework. Specifically, we study nonparametric deconvolution under the assumption that $Z$ is a linear function of an observable multidimensional covariate. This structural constraint allows us to introduce a nonparametric estimator of the distribution of $Z$ which achieves the parametric convergence rate in the Wasserstein distance of order 1, and this independently of the smoothness of the noise distribution. Furthermore, and conditionally on an observed response, we consider the problem of estimating the value of the latent linear predictor, whose link to the observed response is not accessible. Through several simulations, we illustrate the fast convergence rate of our deconvolution estimator and the performance of the proposed conditional estimators of the latent predictor in different simulation scenarios.",

Straightforward formulations of both single- and multi-commodity FNC problems based on the Cell Transmission Model are known to be non-convex, mainly due to the congestion effects at diverge junctions. However, recent studies have shown that it is possible to formulate a tight convex relaxation of the single-commodity FNC problem. We extend these results to the multi-commodity FNC problem by considering concave commodity-specific demand functions and concave aggregate supply functions, so that different variable speed limits can be applied to different commodities. Hence, it is possible to efficiently compute the optimal control action to reduce congestion phenomena in the network. We also present a case study of a segment of the freeway network in California, using data from the PeMS database, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Finally, we draw a comparison with a setting where the multi-commodity flows are modeled and controlled as a single-commodity flow, to emphasize the relevance of acting separately on different classes of vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Non terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems, play a vital role in supporting future mission critical applications such as disaster relief. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native communications enable LEO satellites to act as intelligent edge nodes capable of on board learning and task oriented inference. However, the limited link budget, coupled with severe path loss and fading, significantly constrains reliable downlink transmission. This paper proposes a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC)-based downlink scheme for AI-native LEO networks, optimized for goal-oriented visual inference. In the DJSCC approach, only semantically meaningful features are extracted and transmitted, whereas conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) transmits the original image data. To evaluate information freshness and visual event detection performance, this work introduces the age of misclassified information (AoMI) metric and a threshold based AoI analysis that measures the proportion of users meeting application specific timeliness requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed DJSCC scheme provides higher inference accuracy, lower average AoMI, and greater threshold compliance than the conventional SSCC baseline, enabling semantic communication in AI native LEO satellite networks for 6G and beyond.",

For grids approximating bounded domains in the complex plane, we establish, in the scaling regime, the conformal covariance of the energy density on critical doubly periodic graphs. We complement this result with an analogous statement in the case where the limiting conformal structure generates a maximal surface $(z,\\vartheta)$ in Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^{(2,1)}$. All scaling factors obtained are local and expressed in terms of the geometry of the embedding, even in situations where they vary drastically from one region to another.\n  These results confirm the predictions of Chelkak and highlight that the scaling limits of generic (near-)critical Ising models naturally live on a substantially richer conformal structure than the classical Euclidean one.",

Here $g$ captures general convex objectives and indicator functions for convex constraints, while the composite template simultaneously models convex penalties on smooth features $(h \\circ C)$ and smooth couplings of convex (possibly nonsmooth) features $(s \\circ R)$. Each prox-convex step forms a convex subproblem by linearizing only the smooth maps while preserving the existing convex structure. The resulting subproblem is made strongly convex with the proximal metric $Q_k=\u03bc_k I+H_k^+ \\succ 0$ where $\u03bc_k$ is adapted using an implicit trust-region strategy, and $H_k^+ \\succeq 0$ is an optional curvature term for local acceleration. Under mild Lipschitz/smoothness and a per-coordinate monotone-or-smooth condition, we prove subdifferential regularity, derive two-sided quadratic model error bounds with explicit constants, and obtain sufficient decrease with $O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ complexity for driving the norm of the metric prox-gradient below $\\varepsilon$. Furthermore, a local error-bound condition for $F$ guarantees a metric step-size error bound and hence local $Q$-linear convergence of the function values. Using the Taylor-like model framework of Drusvyatskiy, Ioffe, and Lewis, we show that every cluster point of the iterates is limiting-stationary; under our regularity conditions, this further implies Fr\u00e9chet stationarity.

Framing lattices are remarkable in that they provide a unifying framework encompassing many classical and well-studied lattice structures, including the Boolean lattice, the Tamari lattice, and the weak order on permutations.

Though such problems are often solved through finite-dimensional gradient descent over a parametrization of the functions, such as neural networks, an interesting alternative is to instead perform gradient descent directly in the function space by leveraging its Hilbert space structure, thus enabling provable guarantees and fast convergence. However, infinite-dimensional gradients are often hard to compute in practice, hindering the applicability of such methods. To overcome this limitation, our framework requires only the computation of directional derivatives and a pre-basis for the Hilbert space domain, i.e., a linearly-independent set whose span is dense in the Hilbert space. This fully resolves the tractability issue, as pre-bases are much more easily obtained than full orthonormal bases or reproducing kernels -- which may not even exist -- and individual directional derivatives can be easily computed using forward-mode scalar automatic differentiation. We showcase the use of our method to solve partial differential equations \u00e0 la physics informed neural networks (PINNs), where it effectively enables provable convergence.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing causality in multivariate systems involves establishing how information is generated, distributed and combined, and thus requires tools that capture interactions beyond pairwise relations. Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery.",

    "title": "$L^2-$posterior contraction rates for Gaussian process and random series priors in Bayesian nonparametric regression models",
    "abstract": "The nonparametric regression model with normal errors has been extensively studied, both from the frequentist and Bayesian viewpoint. A central result in Bayesian nonparametrics is that under assumptions on the prior, the data-generating distribution (assuming a true frequentist model) and a semi-metric $\u03c1(.,.)$ on the space of regression functions that satisfy the so called testing condition, the posterior contracts around the true distribution with respect to $\u03c1(.,.)$, and the rate of contraction can be estimated. In the regression setting, the semi-metric $\u03c1(.,.)$ is often taken to be the Hellinger distance or the empirical $L^2$ norm (i.e., the $L^2$ norm with respect to the empirical distribution of the design) in the present regression context. However, extending contraction rates to the ``integrated\" $L^2$ norm usually requires more work, and has previously been done for instance under sufficient smoothness or boundedness assumptions, which may not necessarily hold. In this work we show that, for classes of priors based on random basis expansions or Gaussian processes with RKHS of Sobolev type and in the random design setting, such $L^2$ posterior contraction rates can be obtained under substantially weaker assumptions than those currently used in the literature. Importantly we do not require a known a priori upper bound on its supremum norm or that its smoothness is larger than $d/2$, where $d$ is the dimension of the covariates. Our proof crucially relies on an application of the matrix Bernstein concentration inequality to empirical inner product matrices, which require explicit upper bounds on the basis functions at hand that we prove in several cases of interest. In particular we obtain upper bounds on the supremum norm of Mercer eigenfunctions of several reproducing kernels (including several Mat\u00e9rn kernels) which are of independent interest.",

We study a weighted second moment of the central value of the $L$-function associated to $f$ over an orthogonal basis $H_\u03ba(4)$ of $S_\u03ba(\u0393_0(4))$.

    "abstract": "We consider networks of elastic strings with end masses, where the coupling is modeled via elastic springs. The model is representative of a network of nonlinear strings, where the strings are coupled to elastic bodies. The coupled system converges to the classical string network model with Kirchhoff and continuity transmission conditions as the spring stiffness terms approach infinity and the masses at the nodes vanish. Due to the presence of point masses at the nodes, the boundary conditions become dynamic, and consequently, the corresponding first-order system of quasilinear balance laws exhibits nonlocal boundary conditions. We demonstrate well-posedness in the sense of semi-global classical solutions \\cite{li} (i.e., for arbitrarily large time intervals provided that the initial and boundary data are small enough) and observe extra regularity at the masses as in \\cite{WangLeugeringLi2017,WangLeugeringLi2019}. We prove local and global-local exact boundary controllability of a star-like network when control is active at the endpoints of the string-spring-mass system, except for one clamped end. In this case, at multiple nodes, a complex smoothing pattern appears, leading to asymmetric control spaces when the springs and masses are present. Furthermore, the rank of the Laplacian matrix at the junction is crucial for the controllability property, particularly in models containing wave equations with degeneration at dynamic boundaries, which can be interpreted as damage in mechanical vibration systems where parts of the springs are missing.",

Enlarging the removed corner to a critical size, a phase transition described in terms of the Tracy-Widom distribution occurs.

We formalize the parallel setting between closed subgroups of the absolute Galois group and subgroups of the Mapping Class Group of a base space and their actions on fundamental groups. This provides an analogy between arithmetic and topological invariants, allowing us to define the groups of moduli, definition, and invariance in both settings.\n  Using this unified perspective, some purely group-theoretic proofs provide results in both settings simultaneously. Applications include a topological analogue of Weil's Descent Theorem for mapping class groups and an adaptation of D\u00e9bes and Douai's cohomological obstructions regarding descent of algebraic covers to the topological setting.\n  Finally, we elevate these results to the categorical level. We demonstrate that the classical Weil cocycle condition is equivalent to the existence of a linearization in the language of equivariant categories. Applying this perspective to the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $\\mathsf{D^b}(X)$, we show that the equivariant derived category $\\mathsf{D^b}(X)^G$, under the action induced by a Weil descent datum, recovers the derived category of the descended variety.",

When the space dimension is $2$ or when the damping is strong enough, the solution is global in time. In the second part of this work, a microscopic description of this model is introduced in terms of a system of stochastic moderately interacting particles. This system features two main characteristics: the interaction between particles happens through a singular (Coulomb-type) kernel which is attractive; and the particles are subject to demographic events, birth and death due to local competition with other particles. The latter induces a branching structure of the particle system. Then the main result of this work is the convergence of the empirical measure of the particle system towards the Keller--Segel PDE with logistic damping, with a rate of order $N^{-\\frac{1}{2(d+1)}}$.",

Within the self-similar framework associated with the four-state Riemann problem, we construct a supersonic sonic patch solution that connects a strictly supersonic region to a sonic boundary along a pseudo streamline. The analysis is based on a characteristic decomposition combined with a partial hodograph transformation, through which the problem is reformulated as a degenerate hyperbolic system.

Our results provide a quantitative decomposition of exclusion dynamics into transport and collision effects and clarify how microscopic blocking manifests at the macroscopic and fluctuation levels.",

This concept of randomness is defined relative to an underlying probability measure P on the space of trajectories. In deterministic models like Newtonian N-particle flow in dilute gases of hard spheres (as considered by Boltzmann) or the Kac ring model these may be reduced to their initial conditions, in which case P makes the particles i.i.d. at t=0. In the (stochastic) Ehrenfest urn model, on the other hand, the importance of trajectories as the decisive random objects comes out more clearly. We consider each of these models from this point of view, including a conceptual analysis of the recent (post-Lanford) microscopic derivation of the full Boltzmann equation for long times. We also show to which extent algorithmic randomness is stronger than necessary for the derivation of Boltzmann-like equations, in giving rise to an infinite number of other macroscopic properties. In the light of Chaitin's incompleteness theorems for algorithmic randomness, the price for this scenario is the impossibility of explicitly displaying algorithmically random microscopic trajectories.",

    "title": "Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms",
    "abstract": "Cooperative collision avoidance between robots in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each robot is responsible for making its own control decisions, including motion planning. To this end, most existing approaches mostly rely some form of (wireless) communication between the agents of the swarm. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, transmission faults, and is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) as a communicationless alternative. It follows the implicit cooperation paradigm, under which the design of the robots is based on consensual (offline) rules, similar to traffic rules. They include the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and a method for construction of mutual collision avoidance constraints. The setup is shown to guarantee the recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. Moreover, CMC naturally satisfies the Plug \\& Play paradigm, i.e., for new robots entering the swarm. Two numerical examples demonstrate that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and that the robot swarm operates smoothly under the CMC regime.",

For given integer $n\\ge 2$, we condition the tree on the following $n$-arm event: we pick $n$ branches, emanating from $n$ points microscopically close to a given interior point, and condition them to connect to the boundary $\\partial \u03a9$ without intersecting. What can be said about the geometry of these branches?\n  We derive an exact formula for the characteristic function of the total winding of the branches. A surprising consequence of this formula is that in the scaling limit, the behaviour of this function depends on the total number of branches $n$ only through its parity.\n  We also describe the scaling limit of the branches. If $\u03a9$ is the unit disc, then they hit the boundary (i.e., the unit circle) at random positions which coincide exactly with the eigenvalues of a random matrix of size $n$ drawn from the Circular Orthogonal Ensemble (COE, also called C$\u03b2$E with $\u03b2=1$). Furthermore, the branches converge to Loewner evolution driven by the circular Dyson Brownian motion with parameter $\u03b2= 4$ (i.e., $n$-sided radial SLE$_\u03ba$ with $\u03ba=2$). We thus verify a prediction made by Cardy in this setting.\n  Along the way, we develop a flow-line (imaginary geometry) coupling of $n$-sided radial SLE$_\u03ba$ with the Gaussian free field, which may be of independent interest. Surprisingly, we find that the variance of the corresponding field near the singularity also does not depend on the number $n\\ge 2$ of curves. In contrast, the variance of the the winding of the curves behaves as $\u03ba/n^2$, which agrees with the predictions from the physics literature made by Wieland and Wilson numerically, and by Duplantier and Binder using Coulomb gas methods -- but disagrees with a result of Kenyon.",

Degeneracy in this context is measured by the real parameters for $\u03bc_a\\in [0,2)$ for $a\\in\\{K,EI\\}$, where $K(x)$ denotes shear stiffness and $EI(x)$ bending stiffness. We differentiate between weak degeneracy $\u03bc_a\\in [0,1)$ and strong degeneracy $\u03bc_a\\in [1,2)$, which may occur independently in shear and bending. Our study establishes observability inequalities for both weakly and strongly degenerate equations under Dirichlet, Robin, and Neumann boundary conditions. Using energy multiplier techniques and the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we derive conditions for exact boundary controllability and show that appropriate boundary state and velocity feedback controls at the non-degenerate end can stabilize the system exponentially. Extending results previously obtained for the 1-dimensional wave equation in \\cite{AlabauCannarsaLeugering2017}, this study highlights new control strategies and stabilization effects specific to the degenerate Timoshenko beam system, addressing challenges pertinent to real-world structural damping and control applications.",

We completely realize their approach to give another proof of this Watanabe--Yoshida conjecture. The main ingredient of the proof relies on a new explicit combinatorial formula for the coefficients of this shifted Ehrhart polynomial. In terms of the generating function of the shifted polynomial, this formula manifests itself as a Hadamard product of the exponential generating function of Euler numbers and an explicit algebraic function.",

The lower bound is derived through the Rademacher complexity of neural networks.

The achievable rate depends on the coherent superposition of the effective complex channel gains and is therefore highly sensitive to the relative phase alignment of the activated antennas. To address the prohibitive complexity of exhaustive search, we propose a Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits the phase structure of the combined received signal. The trellis state is defined by a quantized representation of the phase of the accumulated complex gain, and a Viterbi-based survivor rule is used to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in the number of available antennas.",
