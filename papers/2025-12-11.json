    "abstract": "In this paper, an efficient solver for the Helmholtz equation using a noval approximation space is developed. The ingradients of the method include the approximation space recently proposed, a discontinuous Galerkin scheme extensively used, and a linear system solver with a natural preconditioner. Comparing to traditional discontinuous Galerkin methods, we refer to the new method as being more efficient in the following sense. The numerical performance of the new method shows that: 1) much less error can be reached using the same degrees of freedom; 2) the sparse matrix therein has much fewer nonzero entries so that both the storage space and the solution time cost for the iterative solver are reduced; 3) the preconditioner is proved to be optimal with respect to the mesh size in the absorbing case. Such advantage becomes more pronounced as the approximation order increases.",

Building on recent results showing that broom-free graphs excluding $K_d(t)$ as a subgraph admit a polynomial bound in~$t$ on their chromatic number (A broom is obtained from a path with one end $v$ by adding leaves adjacent to $v$), we extend this result to the hereditary class $\\mathcal{H}$ of $C_4$-free and \\emph{$p$-flag}-free graphs (where a \\emph{$p$-flag} is a triangle with an attached $p$-path).

This conjecture was first posed in [Habilitation Thesis, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, 24, 2017]. This is adapted from the Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s--Sumner's conjecture which has been asserted in [The Theory and Applications of Graphs, (G. Chartrand, ed.), John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1981, pp. 557-576].\n  Although the Esperet's conjecture is false in general, in this study we consider an analogue of Esperet's conjecture as follows: Let $C$ be a hereditary class of graphs, and $d \\ge 1$. Suppose that there is a function $f$ such that $\u03c7(G) \\le f(\u03c4_d(G))$ for each $G \\in C$. Can we always choose $f$ to be a polynomial?

The versatility and practical utility of the framework are demonstrated through applications across multiple domains including poroelastic media, nonlinear circuits, constrained mechanics, and phase-field models.

We first establish second-order necessary conditions that incorporate curvature information of the reachable set, providing refined optimality criteria that bridge classical second-variation methods with the geometric $\u039b$-set approach. The framework is then extended to Filippov systems with discontinuous dynamics and to hybrid dynamical systems with state-dependent switching, yielding new necessary conditions for optimality in these settings. Furthermore, we introduce stochastic $\u039b$-sets for systems subject to both continuous diffusion and discrete random switching, connecting the framework to Peng's stochastic maximum principle. Throughout the paper, detailed examples -- including nonholonomic systems, mechanical systems with friction, and stochastic temperature control -- illustrate the theoretical developments and demonstrate the practical applicability of the extended $\u039b$-set theory. The results unify and generalize existing maximum principles, offering a powerful geometric tool for analyzing optimal control problems across a broad spectrum of system classes, from classical smooth systems to modern stochastic hybrid systems.",

It turns out they are also elliptic nets, an $n$--dimensional array with values in $K$ satisfying the same nonlinear recurrence relation that division polynomials do as well. Now further assume the elliptic curve $E/K$ has complex multiplication by an order of a quadratic imaginary field $F \\subseteq K$, we will prove a formula for the common valuation of $\u03a6_{v}$ and $\u03a8_{v}^2$ associated to multiples of points by elements of an order in $F$. As an application, we will use the formula to show that elliptic divisibility sequences associated to multiples of points indexed by elements of an order also satisfy a recurrence relation when indexed by elements of an order, subject to certain conditions on the indices. Additionally, we also expect that the formula may also be used in computing $\\mathcal{O}_K$--integral points of an elliptic curve of rank $2$ with complex multiplication (this is future work).",

This motivates the study of the finite-time behavior of the solutions to scaled inhomogeneous affine Stochastic Volterra equations through the lens of a weaker notion of stationarity referred to as $\\textit{fake stationary regime}$ in the sense that all marginal distributions share the same expectation and variance. As a first application, we introduce the $\\textit{Fake stationary Volterra Heston model}$ and derive a closed-form expression for its characteristic function. Having established this finite-time proxy for stationarity, we then investigate the asymptotic (long-time) behavior to assess whether genuine stationary regimes emerge in the limit. Using an extension of the exponential-affine transformation formula for those processes, we establish in the long run the existence of limiting distributions, which (unlike in the case of classical affine diffusion processes) may depend on the initial state of the process, unless the Volterra kernel coincides with the $\u03b1-$ fractional integration kernel, for which the dependence on the initial state vanishes. We then proceed to the construction of stationary processes associated with these limiting distributions. However, the dynamics in this long-term regime are analytically intractable, and the process itself is not guaranteed to be stationary in the classical sense over finite horizons. This highlights the relevance of finite-time analysis through the lens of the aforementioned $\\textit{fake stationarity}$, which offers a tractable approximation to stationary behavior in genuinely non-stationary Volterra systems.",

Existence and uniqueness of the ground states of the unitary Fermi gases are studied with/without the angular momentum rotation term. We present a regularized normalized gradient flow method to compute the ground states of trapped unitary Fermi gases.

    "abstract": "A two-player finite horizon linear-quadratic Stackelberg differential game is considered. The feature of this game is that the control cost of a follower in the cost functionals of both players is small, which means that the game under consideration is a cheap control game. The open-loop solution of this game is studied. Using the game's solvability conditions, obtaining such a game's solution is reduced to the solution of a proper boundary-value problem. Due to the smallness of the follower's control cost, this boundary-value problem is singularly perturbed. The asymptotic behaviour of the solution to this problem is analysed. Based on this analysis, the asymptotic behaviour of the open-loop optimal players' controls and the optimal values of the cost functionals is studied. Using these results, asymptotically suboptimal players' controls are designed. An illustrative example of a supply chain problem with a small control cost of a retailer is presented.",

    "abstract": "Building on the well-established connection between the Hilbert transform and derivative operators, and motivated by recent developments in complex-step differentiation, we introduce the Complex-Step Integral Transform (CSIT): a generalized integral transform that combines analytic continuation, derivative approximation, and multi-scale smoothing within a unified framework. A spectral analysis shows that the CSIT preserves phase while suppressing high-wavenumber noise, offering advantages over conventional Fourier derivatives. We discuss the roles of the real and imaginary step parameters, compare FFT-based and interpolation-based implementations, and demonstrate the method on the advection equation and instantaneous-frequency computation. Results show that the CSIT yields smoother, more robust attributes than Hilbert-based methods and provides built-in stabilization for PDE solvers. The CSIT thus represents a flexible alternative for numerical differentiation, spectral analysis, and seismic signal processing. The method opens several avenues for future work, including non-periodic implementations, adaptive parameter selection, and integration with local interpolation frameworks such as high-order Finite-Element methods.",

This work demonstrates that the physically motivated decaying term $|x|^{-\u03b1}$ breaks the scaling symmetry inherent in the autonomous case. Such breaking energetically separates the exterior domain problem from the whole space one and thereby prevents energy leakage. Using a novel min-max argument that combines monotonicity trick, Morse index estimates, and blow-up analysis, we prove the existence of a positive mountain pass solution for sufficiently small mass, revealing a new phenomenon of non-autonomous nonlinearities in non-compact domains.",

We consider a Witten Laplacian $-L_{\u03bb,\\mathcal{D}}$ with the Dirichlet boundary condition on a certain domain $\\mathcal{D}\\subset P_{e,a}(G)$ which includes finitely many geodesics $\\{l_1,\\ldots,l_N\\}$ between $e$ and $a$. $\u03bd_{\u03bb,a}$ has the formal path integral expression $\u03bd_{\u03bb,a}(d\u03b3)=Z_\u03bb^{-1}\\exp \\left(-\u03bbE(\u03b3)\\right)d\u03b3$, where $E(\u03b3)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1|\\dot\u03b3(t)|^2dt$ and $E$ is a Morse function when $a$ is not a point of the set of cut-locus of $e$.

However, differently from finite dimensional cases, the spectral sets of the approximate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators contain essential spectrum. It may be difficult to analyze the behavior of the spectrum of $-\u03bb^{-1}L_{\u03bb,\\mathcal{D}}$ near the set of the essential spectrum. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the lowlying discrete spectrum of $-\u03bb^{-1}L_{\u03bb,\\mathcal{D}}$ in the complement of the neighborhood of the set of essential spectrum of the approximate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators at $\\{l_i\\}$.",

Let $Q$ denote the distribution of $Y$. We introduce a hierarchy of denoisers $T_0, T_1, \\ldots, T_\\infty : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that are agnostic to the signal distribution $P$, depending only on higher-order score functions of $Q$. Each denoiser $T_K$ is progressively refined using the $(2K-1)$-th order score function of $Q$ at noise resolution $\u03c3^{2K}$, achieving better denoising quality measured by the Wasserstein metric $W(T_K \\sharp Q, P)$. The limiting denoiser $T_\\infty$ identifies the optimal transport map with $T_\\infty \\sharp Q = P$.\n  We provide a complete characterization of the combinatorial structure underlying this hierarchy through Bell polynomial recursions, revealing how higher-order score functions encode the optimal transport map for signal denoising. We study two estimation strategies with convergence rates for higher-order scores from i.i.d. samples drawn from $Q$: (i) plug-in estimation via Gaussian kernel smoothing, and (ii) direct estimation via higher-order score matching. This hierarchy of agnostic denoisers opens new perspectives in signal denoising and empirical Bayes.",

In particular, we show that, under certain mild assumptions, the image of the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the associated absolute Galois group is not a normal subgroup. Furthermore, we show that, for the absolute Galois group of a mixed-characteristic local field satisfying certain assumptions, there exist a continuous representation and a continuous automorphism of the group such that the former is irreducible, abelian, and crystalline, but the continuous representation obtained as the composite of the former with the latter is not even Hodge-Tate.\n  These results significantly generalize previous works by Hoshi and Nishio. A key observation in obtaining these results is to focus on the analogy between the mapping class groups of topological surfaces and the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of mixed-characteristic local fields. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first work applying results from the theory of mapping class groups to the anabelian geometry of mixed-characteristic local fields, going beyond a mere analogy between the two.",

Bi-fidelity methods mitigate this challenge by leveraging a cheaper, approximate model to accelerate convergence. Most existing bi-fidelity approaches, however, exploit either design-space curvature or random-space correlation, not both. We present BISTRO - a BI-fidelity Stochastic Trust-Region Optimizer for unconstrained optimization under uncertainty through a stochastic approximation procedure. This approach exploits the curvature information of a low-fidelity objective function to converge within a basin of a local minimum of the high-fidelity model where low-fidelity curvature information is no longer valuable. The method then switches to a variance-reduced stochastic gradient descent procedure. We provide convergence guarantees in expectation under certain regularity assumptions and ensure the best-case $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. On benchmark problems and a 20-dimensional space shuttle reentry case, BISTRO converges faster than adaptive sampling and variance reduction procedures and cuts computational expense by up to 29x.",

Firstly, the sectorial tensor decomposition for sectorial tensors is derived, which allows us to define phases for sectorial tensors. A numerical procedure for computing phases of a sectorial tensor is also proposed. Secondly, the maximin and minimax expressions for tensor phases are given, which are used to quantify how close the phases of a sectorial tensor are to those of its compressions. Thirdly, the compound spectrum, compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of two sectorial tensors $A,B$ are defined and characterized in terms of the compound numerical ranges and compound angular numerical ranges of the sectorial tensors $A,B$. Fourthly, it is shown that the angles of eigenvalues of the product of two sectorial tensors are upper bounded by the sum of their individual phases. Finally, based on the tensor phase theory developed above, a tensor version of the small phase theorem is presented, which can be regarded as a natural generalization of the matrix case, recently proposed in Ref. [10]. The results offer powerful new tools for the stability and robustness analysis of multilinear feedback control systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the complex exponential integral means spectrums of univalent functions in the unit disk. We show that all integral means spectrum (IMS) functionals for complex exponents on the universal Teichm\u00fcller space, the closure of the universal Teichm\u00fcller curve, and the universal asymptotic Teichm\u00fcller space are continuous. We also show that the complex exponential integral means spectrum of any univalent function admitting a quasiconformal extension to the extended complex plane is strictly less than the universal integral means spectrum. These results extend some related ones in our recent work \\cite{Jin}. Here we employ a different and more direct approach to prove the continuity of IMS functional on the universal asymptotic Teichm\u00fcller space. Additionally, we completely determine the integral means spectrums of all univalent rational functions in the unit disk. As a consequence, we show that the Brennan conjecture is true for this class of univalent functions. Finally, we present some remarks and raise some problems and conjectures regarding IMS functionals on Teichm\u00fcller spaces, univalent rational functions, and a multiplier operator whose norm is closely related to the Brennan conjecture.",

    "abstract": "$\u03b3$-Liouville quantum gravity ($\u03b3$-LQG) constitutes a family of planar random geometries whose geodesics exhibit intricate fractal behaviour. As is observed in various planar models of random geometry as part of the phenomenon of geodesic confluence, geodesics in $\u03b3$-LQG tend to merge with each other. In particular, in Gwynne-Miller '19, it was established that in $\u03b3$-LQG, geodesics targeted to a fixed point do coalesce in the sense that any two such geodesics almost surely merge before reaching their common target. However, in view of the randomness inherent to the geometry, it is a priori possible that while geodesics targeted to a fixed point do coalesce, there exists a sequence of geodesics $P_n$ converging to an exceptional geodesic $P$ as $n\\rightarrow \\infty$ such that $P_n$ does not overlap with $P$ for any $n$. In this paper, we prove that this is not possible, thereby establishing a strong confluence statement for $\u03b3$-LQG for all $\u03b3\\in (0,2)$. This extends the results obtained in Miller-Qian '20 for $\u03b3=\\sqrt{8/3}$ to all subcritical values of $\u03b3$.

Then we extend the study to a broader class of processes whose behavior at the interface forms an oblique two-dimensional analogue of the skew Brownian motion.\n  We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of this transient process. Our main results are as follows: (i) we derive explicit Laplace transforms of the Green's functions; (ii) we compute exact asymptotics of the Green's functions along all possible trajectories in the plane; (iii) We determine all positive harmonic functions, identifying the full and minimal Martin boundaries, which turn out to be distinct. The nonminimality of the Martin boundary is a noteworthy phenomenon for diffusions with regular coefficients.\n  To obtain an analytical description of the process, we fully develop a three-variable version of the so-called kernel method by deriving and exploiting a functional equation involving unknown Laplace transforms of Green's functions and two known kernels $\u03b3_+(x,y)$ and $\u03b3_{-}(x,z)$.

    "abstract": "Admissible states in hyperbolic systems and related equations often form a convex invariant domain. Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics.",

Leveraging recent advances in Lie-Bracket Averaging for hybrid systems, we demonstrate that the proposed controllers can be formulated as well-posed multi-time-scale hybrid systems that satisfy key regularity, stability, and robustness properties. In extremum-seeking systems, exploration and exploitation are inherently coupled. This coupling necessitates careful consideration in the design of the event-triggered controller. To address this challenge, we incorporate a low-pass filter into the algorithm and carefully design the flow and jump sets of the resulting hybrid system. The resulting controller renders the optimal point semi-globally practically asymptotically stable with solutions exhibiting a uniform semi-global dwell time. We also demonstrate how the proposed event-triggered scheme can be modified to allow analysis using traditional averaging tools for hybrid systems by introducing two independent tunable parameters in the controller. Numerical simulations are presented to validate and illustrate the theoretical results.",

To achieve confidentiality, the proposed system opportunistically exploits intrinsic features of feedback-aided URA without adding any overhead or altering its original structure or operational characteristics. As a result, the proposed system preserves the low-cost advantages of URA, including low delay and minimal signaling overhead, while providing secure communication. To secure transmission, each user generates a secret key and an artificial noise sequence from the feedback signal that the BS broadcasts in previous transmission rounds. This feedback depends on the BS-user channel, making it a private signal for each user. The secure transmission is performed by three actions: encrypting the data using the secret key, sending only the parity bits of the LDPC encoded secret key to allow the legitimate receiver to recover it, and masking these parity bits with the artificial noise. For reception, a receiver algorithm is designed for the legitimate user, and a leakage analysis is provided to quantify the information available to the eavesdropper. The simulation results show that meaningful secrecy is achieved in URA without modifying its structure and with negligible impact on standard performance.",

    "abstract": "Recent approaches for navigating among dynamic threat regions (i.e., weapon engagement zones) have focused on planning entire trajectories. Moreover, the allowance for penetration into these threat regions was based on heuristic measurements of risk. This paper offers an approach for a more reactive (i.e., feedback-based) guidance that is based on closed-form analytical expressions and thereby suitable for onboard, real-time execution. In addition, a risk measurement is formulated based upon the concept of Dynamic Maneuvering Cue (DMC) which measures the amount of turn a vehicle would need to take in its current state in order to put itself outside the threat region. This approach is then extended to handle multiple threat regions simultaneously (with minimal additional computational complexity). Finally, the DMC constraint is applied to a simple feedback controller as well as a model predictive controller (MPC). The MPC shows better performance but at the cost of having to solve an optimization problem online versus the meager computational burden associated with the simple controller. This approach, which is based on assuming the threats are adversarial, may be used as a conservative method for collision avoidance and deconfliction.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic formulation of optimal transport, also known as the Benamou-Brenier formulation, has been extended to the unbalanced case by introducing a source term in the continuity equation. When this source term is penalized based on the Fisher-Rao metric, the resulting model is referred to as the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) setting, and allows for the comparison between any two positive measures without the need for equalized total mass. In recent work, we introduced a constrained variant of this model, in which affine integral equality constraints are imposed along the measure path. In the present paper, we propose a further generalization of this framework, which allows for constraints that apply not just to the density path but also to the momentum and source terms, and incorporates affine inequalities in addition to equality constraints. We prove, under suitable assumptions on the constraints, the well-posedness of the resulting class of convex variational problems. The paper is then primarily devoted to developing an effective numerical pipeline that tackles the corresponding constrained optimization problem based on finite difference discretizations and parallel proximal schemes. Our proposed framework encompasses standard balanced and unbalanced optimal transport, as well as a multitude of natural and practically relevant constraints, and we highlight its versatility via several synthetic and real data examples.",

    "abstract": "The mathematical model of surfactant adsorption under mixed barrier-diffusion control is analyzed using techniques from fractional calculus. The kinetic models of Henry, Langmuir, Frumkin, Volmer and van der Waals are considered. First, treating the Ward-Tordai integral equation as a fractional order one, the partial differential model is transformed into a single fractional ordinary differential equation for the adsorption. A transformation of the obtained equation is proposed that reduces the number of parameters to two dimensionless groups (at Frumkin and van der Waals models a third parameter appears). In the simplest case of Henry adsorption isotherm the fractional differential model depends on a single dimensionless group and an exact solution exists, represented in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions. Based on this solution, second order asymptotes (at small values of the adsorption) are derived for the other models. The asymptotes of the adsorption result in a higher order asymptotes for the surface pressure (surface tension). For small surface coverage, all considered models converge to the Henry model's predictions, making it a universal first-order approximation for the surface tension. Next, the fractional differential model is written as an integral equation %of fractional order that can be considered as a generalization of the well-known Ward-Tordai equation to the case of barrier-diffusion control. For computer simulation of the obtained integral equation a predictor-corrector numerical method is developed and numerical results are presented and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Classical multi-scale methods involving two spatial scales face significant challenges when simulating heterogeneous structures with complicated three-scale spatial configurations. This study proposes an innovative higher-order three-scale (HOTS) computational method, aimed at accurately and efficiently computing the transient nonlinear thermo-mechanical coupling problems of heterogeneous structures with multiple spatial scales. In these heterogeneous structures, temperature-dependent material properties have an important impact on the thermo-mechanical coupling responses, which is the particular interest in this work. At first, the detailed macro-meso-micro correlative model with higher-order correction terms is established by recursively two-scale analysis between macro-meso and meso-micro scales, which enables high-accuracy analysis of temperature-dependent nonlinear thermo-mechanical behaviors of heterogeneous structures with complicated three-scale configurations. The local error analysis mathematically illustrates the well-balanced property of HOTS computational model, endowing it with high computational accuracy. In addition, a two-stage numerical algorithm with off-line and on-line stages is proposed in order to efficiently simulate the nonlinear thermo-mechanical responses of heterogeneous structures with three-level spatial scales and accurately capture their highly oscillatory information at micro-scale. Finally, the high computational efficiency, high numerical accuracy and low computational cost of the presented higher-order three-scale computational approach are substantiated via representative numerical experiments. It can be summarized that this scalable and robust HOTS computational approach offers a reliably numerical tool for nonlinear multiphysics simulation of large-scale heterogeneous structures in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "We present an efficient hybrid Neural Network-Finite Element Method (NN-FEM) for solving the viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice model. The VP model is widely used in climate simulations to represent large-scale sea-ice dynamics. However, the strong nonlinearity introduced by the material law makes VP solvers computationally expensive, with the cost per degree of freedom increasing rapidly under mesh refinement. High spatial resolution is particularly required to capture narrow deformation bands known as linear kinematic features in viscous-plastic models. To improve computational efficiency in simulating such fine-scale deformation features, we propose to enrich coarse-mesh finite element approximations with fine-scale corrections predicted by neural networks trained with high-resolution simulations. The neural network operates locally on small patches of grid elements, which is efficient due to its relatively small size and parallel applicability across grid patches. An advantage of this local approach is that it generalizes well to different right-hand sides and computational domains, since the network operates on small subregions rather than learning details tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions, forcing, or geometry. The numerical examples quantify the runtime and evaluate the error for this hybrid approach with respect to the simulation of sea-ice deformations. Applying the learned network correction enables coarser-grid simulations to achieve qualitatively similar accuracy at approximately 11 times lower computational cost relative to the high-resolution reference simulations. Moreover, the learned correction accelerates the Newton solver by up to 10% compared to runs without the correction at the same mesh resolution.",

    "abstract": "In this monograph, we lay the foundations for a new theory that generalizes real algebraic geometry. Let $R|K$ be a field extension, where $R$ is a real closed field and $K$ is an ordered subfield of $R$. The main objective is to study $K$-algebraic subsets of $R^n$, i.e., those subsets of $R^n$ that are the zero loci of polynomials with coefficients in $K$. Real algebraic geometry already covers the case when $K$ is also a real closed field. Our goal is to extend real algebraic geometry to the case when $K$ is not real closed, for example when $K$ is the field $\\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers. Several new geometric phenomena appear.\n  There is no complex counterpart to this generalized real algebraic geometry. The reason is as follows. If $C|K$ is a field extension with $C$ algebraically closed and $X$ is a $K$-algebraic subset of $C^n$, then Hilbert's Nullstellensatz implies that the ideal of polynomials with coefficients in $C$ that vanish on~$X$ is generated by the ideal of polynomials with coefficients in $K$ that vanish on $X$. In the real realm, this is false in general, for example when we consider field extensions $R|K$ with $R$ real closed and $K=\\mathbb{Q}$.\n  This monograph also presents some applications of the theory developed. Here is an example. The celebrated Nash-Tognoli theorem states that every compact smooth manifold $M$ is diffeomorphic to a nonsingular real algebraic set $M'$, called algebraic model of $M$. The theory developed here provides the theoretical basis to prove that the algebraic model $M'$ of $M$ can be chosen to be $\\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic and $\\mathbb{Q}$-nonsingular. This guarantees for the first time that, up to smooth diffeomorphisms, every compact smooth manifold can be encoded both globally and locally involving only finitely many exact data.",

Large-scale sampling for n=4,5 (460+ million arrangements) provides strong numerical evidence that this characterization extends to larger orders.

Cyqlone unifies algorithms based on the sequential Riccati recursion, parallel Schur complement methods, and cyclic reduction methods, thereby minimizing the required number of floating-point operations, while allowing parallelization across a user-configurable number of processors. Given sufficient parallelism, the solver run time scales with the logarithm of the horizon length (in contrast to the linear scaling of sequential Riccati-based methods), enabling real-time solution of long-horizon problems. Beyond multithreading on multi-core processors, implementations of Cyqlone can also leverage vectorization using batched linear algebra routines. Such batched routines exploit data parallelism using single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) operations, and expose a higher degree of instruction-level parallelism than their non-batched counterparts. This enables them to significantly outperform BLAS and BLASFEO for the small matrices that arise in optimal control. Building on this high-performance linear solver, we develop CyQPALM, a parallel and optimal-control-specific variant of the QPALM quadratic programming solver. It combines the parallel and vectorized linear algebra operations from Cyqlone with a parallel line search and parallel factorization updates, resulting in order-of-magnitude speedups compared to the state-of-the-art HPIPM solver. Open-source C++ implementations of Cyqlone and CyQPALM are available at https://github.com/kul-optec/cyqlone",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the geometric properties of functions within the generalized Robertson class which consists of alpha-starlike functions of order beta. The study's significance lies in providing a deeper understanding of the univalence and geometric behavior of these functions, which are fundamental in complex analysis and geometric function theory. The primary objective is to derive sharp bounds for the norms of the Schwarzian and pre-Schwarzian derivatives for functions in this class. These bounds are expressed in terms of the initial coefficient of the function, specifically focusing on the important case where this initial coefficient is zero. Additionally, the paper establishes sharp distortion and growth theorems for the functions belonging to this generalized class. Finally, the research addresses the radius problem for this function class by determining the sharp radius of concavity and the sharp radius of convexity.",

    "abstract": "We develop a dynamical method for proving the sharp Berezin--Li--Yau inequality. The approach is based on the volume-preserving mean curvature flow and a new monotonicity principle for the Riesz mean $R_\u039b(\u03a9_t)$. For convex domains we show that $R_\u039b$ is monotone non-decreasing along the flow. The key input is a geometric correlation inequality between the boundary spectral density $Q_\u039b$ and the mean curvature $H$, established in all dimensions: in $d=2$ via circular symmetrization, and in $d\\ge 3$ via the boundary Weyl expansion together with the Laugesen--Morpurgo trace minimization principle. Since the flow converges smoothly to the ball, the monotonicity implies the sharp Berezin--Li--Yau bound for every smooth convex domain. As an application, we obtain a sharp dynamical Ces\u00e0ro--P\u00f3lya inequality for eigenvalue averages.",

In some cases, the non-ordinary locus can be recovered by truncating the integral solutions, as in Igusa's classical observation for the Legendre family. We also establish $S$-integrality of expansions of modular forms at cusps in terms of a modular function for (not necessarily arithmetic) Fuchsian groups with modular embeddings, and deduce congruences.

Under mild conditions, we prove the coexistence for two independently distributed branching random walks obeying the same first- and second-order behavior for their extremal particles. To complement this result, we also exhibit examples for the almost-sure absence of coexistence, for $d=1$, in cases where the asymptotic shapes of the walker clouds are calibrated to coincide, thereby answering a question by Deijfen and Vilkas (ECP 28(15):1-11, 2023).

Furthermore, by exploiting its low-rank structure and the spatial decay of correlations, we can obtain a compressed representation with computational complexity of order $\\mathcal{O}(dN)$, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $N$ is the sample size.

With the exception of configurations where one input is located at an endpoint, cases already well studied in the literature, all admissible two-inputs configurations are treated in this paper within a unified framework. The proposed approach relies on a backstepping transformation combined with a reformulation of the closed-loop dynamics as an Integral Difference Equation (IDE). This IDE representation reveals a common structural pattern across configurations and clarifies the role played by delayed dynamics in the stability analysis. Within this formulation, the stabilization problem can be handled using existing IDE control techniques. For most configurations, the stabilization of the PDE system requires an approximate spectral controllability assumption. Remarkably, one specific configuration can be stabilized without imposing any additional spectral condition. In contrast, we also provide an explicit example of a configuration for which the required spectral controllability property fails to hold.",

In this paper, we establish a sharp upper bound for the multiplicity $m(G_\u03c3, \u03bb)$ of any real eigenvalue $\u03bb$ of a connected signed graph $G_\u03c3$ in terms of its girth. Our main result shows that \\[ m(G_\u03c3, \u03bb) \\le n - g(G_\u03c3) + 2, \\] where $n$ is the number of vertices and $g(G_\u03c3)$ is the girth.

Our approach combines Cauchy interlacing, switching equivalence, and a structural analysis of induced cycles in signed graphs.

This forms a coupled system comprising an ODE and the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) of a hyperbolic system with characteristic boundary in a moving domain, where the fluid velocity matches the solid velocity along the normal direction of the solid boundary. We establish the existence of a unique local classical solution to this coupled system. To construct the solution, we first perform a change of variables to reformulate the problem in a fixed spatial domain, and then analyze an approximate system with a non-characteristic boundary. For this nonlinear approximate system, we use the better regularity for the trace of the pressure on the boundary to contruct a solution by a fixed-point argument in which the fluid motion and the solid motion are updated in successive steps.

The nonlinearity is decomposed as the sum of a one-sided, non-globally, Lipschitz continuous function, and of a globally Lipschitz continuous function. The proposed scheme is based on a splitting strategy, where the first nonlinearity is treated using the exact flow of an associated differential equation, and the second one is treated by an explicit Euler approximation. We prove mean-square, strong error estimates for the proposed scheme and show that the order of convergence is $H-1/4$, where $H\\in(1/4,1)$ is the Hurst index. For the proof, we establish new regularity results for real-valued and infinite dimensional fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process depending on the value of the Hurst parameter $H$.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the maximum order $v(k,\u03b8)$ of a connected $k$-regular graph whose second largest eigenvalue is at most $\u03b8$. From Alon-Boppana and Serre, we know that $v(k,\u03b8)$ is finite when $\u03b8< 2\\sqrt{k-1}$ while the work of Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava implies that $v(k,\u03b8)$ is infinite if $\u03b8\\geq 2\\sqrt{k-1}$. Cioab\u0103, Koolen, Nozaki, and Vermette obtained a general upper bound on $v(k, \u03b8)$ via Nozaki's linear programming bound and determined many values of $v(k,\u03b8)$. The graphs attaining this bound are distance-regular and are called Moore polygons. Damerell and Georgiacodis proved that there are no Moore polygons of diameter $6$ or more. For smaller diameters, there are infinitely many Moore polygons.\n  We complement these results by proving two nonexistence results for Moore polygons with specific parameters. We also determine new values of $v(k,\u03b8)$: $v(4, \\sqrt{2}) = 14$ and $v(5, \\sqrt{2}) = v(5,\\sqrt{5}-1)=16$. The former is achieved by the co-Heawood graph, and the latter by the folded $5$-cube. We verify that any connected $5$-regular graph with second eigenvalue $\u03bb_2$ exceeding $1$ satisfies $\u03bb_2 \\geq \\sqrt{5} - 1$, and that the unique $5$-regular graph attaining equality in this bound has $10$ vertices. We prove a stronger form of a 2015 conjecture of Kolokolnikov related to the second eigenvalue of cubic graphs of given order, and observe that other recent results on the second eigenvalue of regular graphs are consequences of the general upper bound theorem on $v(k,\u03b8)$ mentioned above.",

It is known that even $3$-Colouring is NP-complete for $H$-subgraph-free graphs whenever $H$ has a cycle; or a vertex of degree at least $5$; or a component with two vertices of degree $4$, while Colouring is polynomial-time solvable for $H$-subgraph-free graphs if $H$ is a forest of maximum degree at most $3$, in which each component has at most one vertex of degree $3$. For connected graphs $H$, this means that it remains to consider when $H$ is tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$, or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least two vertices of degree $3$. We let $H$ be a so-called subdivided \"H\"-graph, which is either a subdivided $\\mathbb{H}_0$: a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and no vertices of degree $3$, or a subdivided $\\mathbb{H}_1$: a tree of maximum degree $3$ with exactly two vertices of degree $3$. In the literature, only a limited number of polynomial-time and NP-completeness results for these cases are known. We develop new polynomial-time techniques that allow us to determine the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs for all the remaining subdivided \"H\"-graphs, so we fully classify both cases. As a consequence, the complexity of Colouring on $H$-subgraph-free graphs has now been settled for all connected graphs $H$ except when $H$ is a tree of maximum degree $4$ with exactly one vertex of degree $4$ and at least one vertex of degree $3$; or a tree of maximum degree $3$ with at least three vertices of degree $3$.

Compared to analogous results already available in the literature, our inequalities are established: (i) on fairly general polytopic meshes (with arbitrary number of facets and arbitrarily small facets); (ii) without the need of finite dimensional arguments (e.g., inverse estimates, approximation properties of averaging operators); (iii) for different ranges of maximal and nonmaximal Lebesgue indices.",

In particular, in addition to the already established position-space renormalization Hopf algebra, we also construct the renormalized Feynman rules and the counterterm map via an algebraic Birkhoff decomposition. This includes a discussion about the appropriate target algebra of regularized distributions and the renormalization scheme as a Rota--Baxter operator thereon. In particular, we show that the Hadamard singular part satisfies the Rota--Baxter property and thus relate factorization in Epstein--Glaser with multiplicativity in Connes--Kreimer. Next, we define $Z$-factors as the images of the counterterm map under the corresponding combinatorial Green's functions. This allows us to define the multiplicatively renormalized Lagrange density, for which we show that the corresponding Feynman rules are regular. Finally, we exemplify the developed theory by working out the specific case of $\u03c6^3_6$-theory.",

However, their applicability is limited when dealing with inconsistent systems or incorporating structural information such as sparsity. In this work, we propose a \\emph{relaxed randomized averaging block extended Bregman-Kaczmarz} (rRABEBK) method for solving a broad class of combined optimization problems. The proposed method integrates an averaging block strategy with two relaxation parameters to accelerate convergence and enhance numerical stability. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that rRABEBK achieves linear convergence in expectation, with explicit constants that quantify the effect of the relaxation mechanism, and a provably faster rate than the classical randomized extended Bregman-Kaczmarz method. Our method can be readily adapted to sparse least-squares problems and extended to both consistent and inconsistent systems without modification. Complementary numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that rRABEBK significantly outperforms the existing Kaczmarz-type algorithms in terms of both iteration complexity and computational efficiency, highlighting both its practical and theoretical advantages.",

While they have shown considerable empirical success, significant challenges remain -- particularly regarding training stability and the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees, especially when compared to classical mesh-based methods. In this work, we focus on the inverse problem of identifying a spatially varying parameter in a constitutive model of three-dimensional elasticity, using measurements of the system's state. This setting is especially relevant for non-invasive diagnosis in cardiac biomechanics, where one must also carefully account for the type of boundary data available. To address this inverse problem, we adopt an all-at-once optimisation framework, simultaneously estimating the state and parameter through a least-squares loss that encodes both available data and the governing physics. For this formulation, we prove stability estimates ensuring that our approach yields a stable approximation of the underlying ground-truth parameter of the physical system independent of a specific discretisation. We then proceed with a neural network-based discretisation and compare it to traditional mesh-based approaches. Our theoretical findings are complemented by illustrative numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "Standard complexity analyses for weakly convex optimization rely on the Moreau envelope technique proposed by Davis and Drusvyatskiy (2019). The main insight is that nonsmooth algorithms, such as proximal subgradient, proximal point, and their stochastic variants, implicitly minimize a smooth surrogate function induced by the Moreau envelope. Meanwhile, explicit smoothing, which directly minimizes a smooth approximation of the objective, has long been recognized as an efficient strategy for nonsmooth optimization. In this paper, we generalize the notion of smoothable functions, which was proposed by Beck and Teboulle (2012) for nonsmooth convex optimization. This generalization provides a unified viewpoint on several important smoothing techniques for weakly convex optimization, including Nesterov-type smoothing and Moreau envelope smoothing. Our theory yields a framework for designing smooth approximation algorithms for both deterministic and stochastic weakly convex problems with provable complexity guarantees. Furthermore, our theory extends to the smooth approximation of non-Lipschitz functions, allowing for complexity analysis even when global Lipschitz continuity does not hold.",

To any such module we associate a Rost-Schmid type complex whose homology defines a Borel-Moore intersection theory with quadratic coefficients, satisfying homotopy invariance, localization, proper pushforwards, smooth pullbacks, and Gysin morphisms for essentially smoothable lci morphisms.\n  Using duality data induced by pinning structures, we define cohomological Milnor-Witt modules and establish a duality equivalence between homological and cohomological theories. As applications, we extend Chow-Witt groups to schemes over general (possibly singular or arithmetic) bases, prove generalized Bloch formulas and representability results, and compute graded Chow-Witt groups over Dedekind schemes of finite type over the integers. In particular, we obtain finiteness results for Chow-Witt and related Milnor-Witt invariants in dimension at most one.",

    "title": "Effective Operators in the Theory of Composites: Hilbert Space Framework",
    "abstract": "In this chapter, the Hilbert space framework in the mathematical theory of composite materials is introduced for studying the properties of effective operators. The goal is to introduce some of the key concepts and fundamental theorems in this area while showing that they follow naturally from using only basic results in operator theory on Hilbert spaces. These concepts include the $Z$-problem as an abstraction of a constitutive equation defined in terms of a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with a Hodge decomposition, direct and dual $Z$-problems with the duality interpretation of the inverse of an effective operator, and the notion of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection. These theorems include sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of both the solution of a $Z$-problem and the effective operator of a $Z$-problem, a representation formula for the effective operator as an operator Schur complement, the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles for the effective operator, the result on monotonicity and concavity of the effective operator map, and the Keller-Dykhne-Mendelson duality relations. Moreover, another important theorem given here (which may also be of independent interest to systems theorists) says that an effective operator of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection is the Schur complement of a normalized homogeneous semidefinite operator pencil (in particular, has a Bessmertny\u012d realization) and, up to a unitary equivalence, the converse is also true. Finally, the general theory presented here is shown to recover classical results dealing with effective conductivity but can also be applied to many other important problems involving composites in physics and engineering, e.g., in elasticity and electromagnetism.",

    "title": "Stochastic Fleet Size and Mix Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem for Last Mile Delivery",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the joint optimization of fleet size and mix, along with vehicle routing, under uncertain customer demand. We propose a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model, where first-stage decisions concern the composition of the delivery fleet and the design of consistent baseline routes. In the second stage, approximate recourse actions are introduced to adapt the initial routes in response to realized customer demands. The objective is to minimize the total delivery cost, including vehicle acquisition, travel distance, and penalty costs for unserved demand. To tackle the computational challenges arising in realistic problem instances, we develop a path-based reformulation of the model and design a Kernel Search-based heuristic to enhance scalability. Computational experiments on small synthetic instances, generated through a population-density-based sampling approach, are conducted to validate the formulation and assess the effects of demand stochasticity through standard stochastic measures, after applying a scenario reduction technique. Additional tests on large-scale real-world instances, based on data from the Italian postal company, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide managerial and practical insights.",

    "title": "Computer-Assisted Search for Differential Equations Corresponding to Optimization Methods and Their Convergence Rates",
    "abstract": "Let $f:\\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuously differentiable convex function with its minimizer denoted by $x_*$ and optimal value $f_* = f(x_*)$. Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies.",

    "title": "A simple geometric proof for the characterisation of e-merging functions",
    "abstract": "E-values offer a powerful framework for aggregating evidence across different (possibly dependent) statistical experiments. A fundamental question is to identify e-merging functions, namely mappings that merge several e-values into a single valid e-value. A simple and elegant characterisation of this function class was recently obtained by Wang(2025), though via technically involved arguments. This note gives a short and intuitive geometric proof of the same characterisation, based on a supporting hyperplane argument applied to concave envelopes. We also show that the result holds even without imposing monotonicity in the definition of e-merging functions, which was needed for the existing proof. This shows that any non-monotone merging rule is automatically dominated by a monotone one, and hence extending the definition beyond the monotone case brings no additional generality.",
