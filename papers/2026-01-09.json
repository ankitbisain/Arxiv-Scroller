    "abstract": "It is well-known that an associative algebra shares the same growth and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension (GK-dimension) as its associated monomial algebra with respect to a degree-lexicographic order. This article mainly investigates the relationship between the GK-dimension of an algebra and that of its associated monomial algebra with respect to a monomial order. We obtain sufficient conditions on a monomial order such that these two algebras have the same GK-dimension. Our result generalizes the well-known result and has several applications. In particular, as an application, we study the growth of Manturov $(k,n)$-groups for positive integers $n>k$. It is shown that the Manturov $(1,n)$-group has growth equal to $0$ for all $n>1$; the Manturov $(2,3)$-group has growth equal to $2$; and, for all $n>k\\geq3$, the Manturov $(k,n)$-group contains a free subgroup of rank $2$ and thus has exponential growth.",

Our result extends the well-known results on uniqueness of equilibrium states in this setting, notably the results of Denker, Przytycki and Urba\u0144ski. We extend the class of potentials from H\u00f6lder to those with the Bowen property on 'good orbits' and present an improvement on the pressure gap condition. Our pressure gap condition is sharp in the class of potentials we consider. In the family of geometric potentials, our approach gives a simple new proof of uniqueness of equilibrium states up to the phase transition that occurs at the Hausdorff dimension of the Julia set. For H\u00f6lder potentials, we show that our equilibrium state has positive entropy. This shows a posteriori that our pressure gap is equivalent to the a priori stronger condition that the potential is hyperbolic and this yields strong statistical properties for the equilibrium state.",

In a wavelet-Galerkin framework, we formulate learning over this class as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to obtaining convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.",

    "abstract": "This work was intended to be all about, and only about, hypergeometric 3F2(1). The initial goal was to revisit many identities from the literature that have been derived over the years and show that they can be obtained in a simpler way armed, with only a minimum of elementary identities. That goal has been achieved as a (patient) reader will discover. In another sense, this work is a partial review of the last half-century's worth of progress in the evaluation of a particular set of 3F2(1), in particular those cases where at least one parameter is an integer or two or more parameters are separated by an integer. The result is a collection of very general identities (or techniques) that an analyst seeking to evaluate a particular 3F2(1), might want to consider as a starting point. That is the secondary goal.\n  Along the way however, the temptation arose to investigate at least one of the unanswered questions that others have raised. This led to a few digressions, and some possibly new results. The reader is invited to follow where curiosity led me to depart from a straightforward review of the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "A central topic in extremal graph theory is the supersaturation problem, which studies the minimum number of copies of a fixed substructure that must appear in any graph with more edges than the corresponding Tur\u00e1n number. Significant works due to Erd\u0151s, Rademacher, Lov\u00e1sz and Simonovits investigated the supersaturation problem for the triangle. Moreover, Kang, Makai and Pikhurko studied the case for the bowtie, which consists of two triangles sharing a vertex. Building upon the pivotal results established by Bollob\u00e1s, Nikiforov, Ning and Zhai on counting triangles via the spectral radius, we study in this paper the spectral supersaturation problem for the bowtie. Let $\u03bb(G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$, and let $K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}^q$ be the graph obtained from Tur\u00e1n graph $T_{n,2}$ by adding $q$ pairwise disjoint edges to the partite set of size $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil$. Firstly, we prove that there exists an absolute constant $\u03b4>0$ such that if $n$ is sufficiently large, $2\\le q \\le \u03b4\\sqrt{n}$, and $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\u03bb(G)\\ge \u03bb(K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}^q)$, then $G$ contains at least ${q\\choose 2}\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$ bowties, and $K_{\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}\\rceil, \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor}^q$ is the unique spectral extremal graph. This solves an open problem proposed by Li, Feng and Peng. Secondly, we show that a graph $G$ whose spectral radius exceeds that of the spectral extremal graph for the bowtie must contain at least $\\lfloor \\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor$ bowties. This sharp bound reveals a distinct phenomenon from the edge-supersaturation case, which guarantees at least $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$ bowties.",

Under minimal integrability and boundedness assumptions on the graphon, we establish distributional limits for simple, well-separated eigenvalues of the associated integral operator. We show that a sharp dichotomy governs the asymptotic behavior. In the non-degenerate regime, the properly normalized empirical eigenvalue satisfies a central limit theorem with an explicit variance, whereas in the degenerate regime, the leading fluctuations vanish and the centered eigenvalue converges to an explicit weighted chi-square limit determined by the operator spectrum. Our analysis requires no smoothness or Lipschitz-type assumptions on the graphon. While earlier work under comparable integrability conditions established operator convergence and eigenspace consistency, the present results characterize the full fluctuation behavior of individual eigenvalues, thereby extending eigenvalue fluctuation theory beyond regimes accessible through operator convergence alone.",

    "title": "The explicit constraint force method for optimal experimental design",
    "abstract": "The explicit constraint force method (ECFM) was recently introduced as a novel formulation of the physics-informed solution reconstruction problem, and was subsequently extended to inverse problems. In both solution reconstruction and inverse problems, model parameters are estimated with the help of measurement data. In practice, experimentalists seek to design experiments such that the acquired data leads to the most robust recovery of the missing parameters in a subsequent inverse problem. While there are well-established techniques for designing experiments with standard approaches to the inverse problem, optimal experimental design (OED) has yet to be explored with the ECFM formulation. In this work, we investigate OED with a constraint force objective. First, we review traditional approaches to OED based on the Fisher information matrix, and propose an analogous formulation based on constraint forces. Next, we reflect on the different interpretations of the objective from standard and constraint force-based inverse problems. We then test our method on several example problems. These examples suggest that an experiment which is optimal in the sense of constraint forces tends to position measurements in the stiffest regions of the system. Because the responses -- and thus the measurements -- are small in these regions, this strategy is impractical in the presence of measurement noise and/or finite measurement precision. As such, our provisional conclusion is that ECFM is not a viable approach to OED.",

The projective eigenvariety $\\mathbb{V}_\u03bb(\\mathcal{A})$ is defined as the set of eigenvectors of $\\mathcal{A}$ associated with $\u03bb$, considered in the complex projective space. For a connected uniform hypergraph $H$, let $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ and $\\mathcal{L}(H)$ denote its adjacency tensor and Laplacian tensor, respectively. Let $\u03c1$ be the spectral radius of $\\mathcal{A}(H)$, for which it is known that $|\\mathbb{V}_\u03c1(\\mathcal{A}(H))| = |\\mathbb{V}_{0}(\\mathcal{L}(H))|$.

Starting from a high-order spatial baseline discretisation (in this case, the CIP stabilised finite element method), our approach formulates the fully discrete problem as a variational inequality posed on a closed convex set of tensor-valued functions that respect the same eigenvalue bounds at their degrees of freedom. The numerical realisation of the scheme relies on the definition of a projection that, at each node, performs the diagonalisation of the tensor and then truncates the eigenvalues to lie within the prescribed bounds. The temporal discretisation is carried out using the implicit Euler method, and unconditional stability and optimal-order error estimates are proven for this choice. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate the method's ability to maintain eigenvalue constraints while accurately approximating solutions in the convection-dominated regime.",

In the algebraic setting, where straight-line programs can be interpreted as circuits over algebraic structures such as semigroups or groups, they have led to deep insights in computational complexity.\n  A key result by Babai and Szemer\u00e9di (1984) showed that finite groups afford efficient compression via straight-line programs, enabling the design of a black-box computation model for groups. Building on their result, Fleischer (2019) placed the Cayley table membership problem for certain classes (pseudovarieties) of finite semigroups in NPOLYLOGTIME, and in some cases even in FOLL. He also provided a complete classification of pseudovarieties of finite monoids affording efficient compression.\n  In this work, we complete this classification program initiated by Fleischer, characterizing precisely those pseudovarieties of finite semigroups that afford efficient compression via straight-line programs. Along the way, we also improve several known bounds on the length and width of straight-line programs over semigroups, monoids, and groups. These results lead to new upper bounds for the membership problem in the Cayley table model: for all pseudovarieties that afford efficient compression and do not contain any nonsolvable group, we obtain FOLL algorithms. In particular, we resolve a conjecture of Barrington, Kadau, Lange, and McKenzie (2001), showing that the membership problem for all solvable groups is in FOLL.",

Minary represents interacting probabilistic events as multi-dimensional vectors and combines them via linear superposition rather than multiplicative scalar operations, thereby preserving uncertainty and enabling constructive and destructive interference in the range $[-1,1]$. A fixed set of ``perspectives'' evaluates ``semantic dimensions'' according to hidden competencies, and their interactions drive two discrete-time stochastic processes. We model this system as an iterated random affine map and use the theory of iterated random functions to prove that it converges in distribution to a unique stationary law; we moreover obtain an explicit closed form for the limiting expectation in terms of row, column, and global averages of the competency matrix. We then derive exact formulas for the mean and variance of the normalized consensus conditioned on the activation of a given semantic dimension, revealing how consensus depends on competency structure rather than raw input signals. Finally, we argue that Minary is organizationally closed yet operationally open in the sense of Maturana and Varela, and we discuss implications for building self-maintaining, distributed, and parallelizable computational systems that house a uniquely subjective notion of identity.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a computational framework for modeling wave propagation in geometrically linear elastic materials characterized by algebraically nonlinear constitutive relations. We derive a specific form of the nonlinear wave equation in which the nonlinearity explicitly appears in the time-derivative terms that govern the evolution of the mechanical fields. The numerical solution is established using a fully discrete formulation that combines the standard finite element method for spatial discretization with the implicit Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT)-$\u03b1$ scheme for time integration. To address the nonlinear nature of the discrete system, we employ Newton's method to iteratively solve the linearized equations at each time step. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework are rigorously verified through convergence analyses, which demonstrate optimal convergence rates in both space and time. Furthermore, a detailed parametric study is conducted to elucidate the influence of the model's constitutive parameters. The results reveal that the magnitude parameter of the stress-dependent variation in wave speed leads to wavefront steepening and the formation of shock discontinuities. Conversely, the exponent parameter acts as a nonlinearity filter; high values suppress nonlinear effects in small-strain regimes, whereas low values allow significant dispersive behavior. This work provides a validated tool for analyzing shock formation in advanced nonlinear materials.",

    "abstract": "In the Material Point Method (MPM), accurately imposing Neumann-type thermal boundary conditions, particularly convective heat flux boundaries, remains a significant challenge due to the inherent nonconformity between complex evolving material boundaries and the fixed background grid. This paper introduces a novel Virtual Heat Flux Method (VHFM) to overcome this limitation. The core idea is to construct a virtual flux field on an auxiliary domain surrounding the physical boundary, which exactly satisfies the prescribed boundary condition. This transforms the surface integral in the weak form into an equivalent, and easily computed, volumetric integral. Consequently, VHFM eliminates the need for explicit boundary tracking, specialized boundary particles, or complex surface reconstruction. A unified formulation is presented, demonstrating the method's straightforward extension to general scalar, vector, and tensor Neumann conditions. The accuracy, robustness, and convergence of VHFM are rigorously validated through a series of numerical benchmarks, including 1D transient analysis, 2D and 3D curved boundaries, and problems with large rotations and complex moving geometries. The results show that VHFM achieves accuracy comparable to conforming node-based imposition and significantly outperforms conventional particle-based approaches. Its simplicity, computational efficiency, and robustness make it an attractive solution for integrating accurate thermal boundary conditions into thermo-mechanical and other multiphysics MPM frameworks.",

    "abstract": "The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes.",

    "abstract": "The performance of eigenvalue problem solvers (eigensolvers) depends on various factors such as preconditioning and eigenvalue distribution. Developing stable and rapidly converging vectorwise eigensolvers is a crucial step in improving the overall efficiency of their blockwise implementations. The present paper is concerned with the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method for Hermitian eigenvalue problems, and motivated by two recently proposed alternatives for its single-vector version LOPCG. A common basis of these eigensolvers is the well-known CG method for linear systems. However, the optimality of CG search directions cannot perfectly be transferred to CG-like eigensolvers. In particular, while computing clustered eigenvalues, LOPCG and its alternatives suffer from frequent delays, leading to a staircase-shaped convergence behavior which cannot be explained by the existing estimates. Keeping this in mind, we construct a class of cluster robust vector iterations where LOPCG is replaced by asymptotically equivalent two-term recurrences and the search directions are timely corrected by selecting a far previous iterate as augmentation. The new approach significantly reduces the number of required steps and the total computational time.",

    "title": "Wireless Communication with Cross-Linked Rotatable Antenna Array: Architecture Design and Rotation Optimization",
    "abstract": "Rotatable antenna (RA) technology can harness additional spatial degrees of freedom by enabling the dynamic three-dimensional orientation control of each antenna. Unfortunately, the hardware cost and control complexity of traditional RA systems is proportional to the number of RAs. To address the issue, we consider a cross-linked (CL) RA structure, which enables the coordinated rotation of multiple antennas, thereby offering a cost-effective solution. To evaluate the performance of the CL-RA array, we investigate a CL-RA-aided uplink system. Specifically, we first establish system models for both antenna element-level and antenna panel-level rotation. Then, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming at the base station and the rotation angles. For the antenna element-level rotation, we derive the optimal solution of the CL-RA array under the single-user case. Subsequently, for two rotation schemes, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem in the multi-user case, where the receive beamforming and the antenna rotation angles are obtained by applying the minimum mean square error method and feasible direction method, respectively. In addition, considering the hardware limitations, we apply the genetic algorithm to address the discrete rotation angles selection problem. Simulation results show that by carefully designing the row-column partition scheme, the performance of the CL-RA architecture is quite close to that of the flexible antenna orientation scheme. Moreover, the CL antenna element-level scheme surpasses the CL antenna panel-level scheme by 25% and delivers a 128% performance improvement over conventional fixed-direction antennas.",

In this paper, we consider the inherent problem stems from the prior knowledge about the signal's structure, such as sparsity which is critical for signal recovery models. We investigate three constrained optimization models that effectively address this challenge, each leveraging distinct forms of structural priors to regularize the solution space. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that these models exhibit robustness to noise while maintaining stability with respect to tuning parameters that is a crucial property for practical applications, when the parameter selection is often nontrivial. By providing theoretical foundations, our work supports their practical use in scenarios where measurement imperfections and model uncertainties are unavoidable. Furthermore, under mild conditions, we establish tradeoff between the sample complexity and the mismatch error.",

In this model, the interplay between reaction kinetics and slow diffusion forms a sharp interface that partitions the domain into high- and low-concentration regions. We perform a detailed asymptotic analysis and derive higher-order approximation equations governing the motion of this interface. Our results show that on a fast timescale, the interface evolves via propagating front dynamics, whereas on a slow timescale, it evolves as an area-preserving mean curvature flow. Furthermore, using the derived free boundary problem, we demonstrate that on a significantly slower timescale, an interface whose endpoints lie on the domain boundary drifts along the boundary toward regions of higher curvature. In summary, our analysis reveals that the interface dynamics in the wave-pinning model exhibit a hierarchy of three distinct timescales: wave propagation on a fast timescale, curvature-driven area-preserving evolution on a slow timescale, and motion along the boundary on a significantly slower timescale.",

    "abstract": "Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a pivotal role in ensuring seamless connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly in scenarios where conventional terrestrial networks are constrained or temporarily unavailable. However, traditional coverage-hole detection approaches, such as minimizing drive tests, are costly, time-consuming, and reliant on outdated radio-environment data, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a UAV-assisted framework for real-time detection and recovery of coverage holes in IoT networks. In the proposed scheme, a patrol UAV is first dispatched to identify coverage holes in regions where the operational status of terrestrial base stations (BSs) is uncertain. Once a coverage hole is detected, one or more UAVs acting as aerial BSs are deployed by a satellite or nearby operational BSs to restore connectivity. The UAV swarm is organized based on Delaunay triangulation, enabling scalable deployment and tractable analytical characterization using stochastic geometry. Moreover, a collision-avoidance mechanism grounded in multi-agent system theory ensures safe and coordinated motion among multiple UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high efficiency in both coverage-hole detection and on-demand connectivity restoration while significantly reducing operational cost and time.",

The estimator is defined as the least concave majorant on the positive half-line of the deconvolution estimator of the distribution function. We show its uniform consistency and its square root convergence in law in $\\ell_\\infty(\\mathbb R)$. To assess the validity of the concavity assumption, we construct a test for the nonparametric null hypothesis that the distribution function is concave on the positive half-line, against the alternative that it is not. We calibrate the test using bootstrap methods. The theoretical justification for calibration led us to establish a bootstrap version of Theorem 1 in S\u00f6hl and Trabs (2012), a Donsker-type result from which we obtain, as a special case, the limiting behavior of the deconvolution estimator of the distribution function in a bootstrap setting with measurement error. Combining this Donsker-type theorem with the functional delta method, we show that the test statistic and its bootstrap version have the same limiting distribution under the null hypothesis, whereas under the alternative, the bootstrap statistic is stochastically smaller. Consequently, the power of the test tends to one, for any fixed alternative, as the sample size tends to infinity. In addition to the theoretical results for the estimator and the test, we investigate their finite-sample performance in simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis for Virtual Element discretizations of incompressible non-Newtonian flows governed by the Carreau-Yasuda constitutive law, in the shear-thickening regime (r > 2) including both degenerate (delta = 0) and non-degenerate (delta > 0) cases. The proposed Virtual Element method features two distinguishing advantages: the construction of an exactly divergence-free discrete velocity field and compatibility with general polygonal meshes. The analysis presented in this work extends a previous work, where only shear-thinning behavior (1 < r < 2) was considered. Indeed, the theoretical analysis of the shear-thickening setting requires several novel analytical tools, including: an inf-sup stability analysis of the discrete velocity-pressure coupling in non-Hilbertian norms, a stabilization term specifically designed to address the nonlinear structure as the exponent r > 2; and the introduction of a suitable discrete norm tailored to the underlying nonlinear constitutive relation. Numerical results demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed formulation.",

This weak law of large numbers morally says that $\u0394_n$ behaves like a sum of i.i.d. random variables that have a finite moment of order $2q$ as long as the log-norm of each matrices has a finite moment of order $q$ for a given $q > 0$.\n  This gain of moment is the central result of the present paper and is based on the construction of pivotal times.

Ultrametrics are essentially distances that can be represented by an edge-weighted rooted tree so that all of the distances in the tree from the root to any leaf of the tree are equal. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of ultrametrics called arboreal ultrametrics which have applications in phylogenetics and also arise in the theory of distance-hereditary graphs. These are partial distances, that is distances that are not necessarily defined for every pair of elements in the groundset, that can be represented by an ultrametric arboreal network, that is, an edge-weighted rooted network whose underlying graph is a tree. As with ultrametrics all of the distances in the ultrametric arboreal network from any root to any leaf below it are are equal but, in contrast, the network may have more than one root. In our two main results we characterize when a partial distance is an arboreal ultrametric as well as proving that, somewhat surprisingly, given any unrooted edge-weighted phylogenetic tree there is a necessarily unique way to insert roots into this tree so as to obtain an arboreal ultrametric.",

    "title": "Privacy-Utility Trade-offs Under Multi-Level Point-Wise Leakage Constraints",
    "abstract": "An information-theoretic privacy mechanism design is studied, where an agent observes useful data $Y$ which is correlated with the private data $X$. The agent wants to reveal the information to a user, hence, the agent utilizes a privacy mechanism to produce disclosed data $U$ that can be revealed. We assume that the agent has no direct access to $X$, i.e., the private data is hidden. We study privacy mechanism design that maximizes the disclosed information about $Y$, measured by the mutual information between $Y$ and $U$, while satisfying a point-wise constraint with different privacy leakage budgets. We introduce a new measure, called the \\emph{multi-level point-wise leakage}, which allows us to impose different leakage levels for different realizations of $U$. In contrast to previous studies on point-wise measures, which use the same leakage level for each realization, we consider a more general scenario in which each data point can leak information up to a different threshold. As a result, this concept also covers cases in which some data points should not leak any information about the private data, i.e., they must satisfy perfect privacy. In other words, a combination of perfect privacy and non-zero leakage can be considered. When the leakage is sufficiently small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the mutual information. We show that when the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, utilizing this approximation leads to a quadratic optimization problem that has closed-form solution under some constraints. In particular, we show that it is sufficient to consider only binary $U$ to attain the optimal utility. This leads to simple privacy designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix.",

    "title": "Nonlinear parametrization solver for fractional Burgers equations",
    "abstract": "Fractional Burgers equations pose substantial challenges for classical numerical methods due to the combined effects of nonlocality and shock-forming nonlinear dynamics. In particular, linear approximation frameworks-such as spectral, finite-difference, or discontinuous Galerkin methods-often suffer from Gibbs-type oscillations or require carefully tuned stabilization mechanisms, whose effectiveness degrades in transport-dominated and long-time integration regimes. In this work, we introduce a sequential-in-time nonlinear parametrization (STNP) for solving fractional Burgers equations, including models with a fractional Laplacian or with nonlocal nonlinear fluxes. The solution is represented by a nonlinear parametric ansatz, and the parameter evolution is obtained by projecting the governing dynamics onto the tangent space of the parameter manifold through a regularized least-squares formulation at each time step. This yields a well-posed and stable time-marching scheme that preserves causality and avoids global-in-time optimization. We provide a theoretical analysis of the resulting projected dynamics, including a stability estimate and an a posteriori error bound that explicitly decomposes the total error into contributions from initial condition fitting, projection residuals, and discretization of fractional operators. Our analysis clarifies the stabilizing role of regularization and quantifies its interaction with the nonlocal discretization error. Numerical experiments for both fractional Burgers models demonstrate that STNP achieves oscillation-free shock resolution and accurately captures long-time dynamics. The method consistently outperforms high-order spectral schemes augmented with spectral vanishing viscosity, while requiring significantly fewer degrees of freedom and avoiding ad hoc stabilization.",

Existing methods for computing regions require the explicit equation of the hypersurface as input. However, computing this equation by elimination can be computationally demanding or even infeasible. Our approach instead derives from univariate interpolation by computing the intersection of the hypersurface with a line. Such an intersection can be done using so-called pseudo-witness sets without computing a defining equation for the hypersurface - we perform elimination without actually eliminating. We implement our approach in a forthcoming Julia package and demonstrate, on several examples, that the resulting algorithm accurately recovers all regions of the real complement of a hypersurface.",

This study assesses the feasibility of ssRIS deployment by analyzing two harvest-and-reflect (HaR) schemes: element-splitting (ES) and time-splitting (TS). We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness.",

A Hecke vector-form can be viewed as a vector function represen- tation of some quasiautomorphic form that transforms like an automorphic form on an arbitrarily chosen Hecke triangle group. In other words, because quasiautomorphic forms have complicated transformation behavior when compared with automorphic forms, the construction of a Hecke vector-form is to retrieve a transformation behavior analogous to the simpler, automor- phic case. In this way, a Hecke vector-form can be viewed as the vector function analogue of an automorphic form. Since our work is for any quasi- automorphic form over an arbitrary Hecke triangle group, we briefly review the construction of such groups. Furthermore, we review the derivation of the hauptmodul, the automorphic forms, and the normalized quasiautomor- phic form of weight 2 for any Hecke triangle group. We then proceed to the theory of Hecke vector-forms and establish the desired transformation be- havior with respect to the generators of the associated group. A proof of this fact is strictly elementary, relying on fine properties of binomial coefficients. Lastly, we relate the vector-forms to Hecke automorphic linear differential equations, which are analogues of the frequently researched modular linear differential equations. Our results include Hecke vector-forms of the classical quasimodular forms as the simplest case.",

    "abstract": "By their nature it is difficult to differentiate chaotic dynamical systems through measurement. In recent years, work has begun on using methods of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to qualitatively type dynamical data by approximating the topology of the underlying attracting set. This comes with the additional challenges of high dimensionality incurring computational complexity along with the lack of directional information encoded in the approximated topology. Due to the latter fact, standard methods of TDA for this high dimensional dynamical data do not differentiate between periodic cycles and non-periodic cycles in the attractor. We present a framework to address both of these challenges. We begin by binning the dynamical data, and capturing the sequential information in the form of a coarse-grained weighted and directed network. We then calculate the persistent Dowker homology of the asymmetric network, encoding spatial and temporal information. Analytically, we highlight the differences in periodic and non-periodic cycles by providing a full characterization of their one-dimensional Dowker persistences. We prove how the homologies of graph wedge sums can be described in terms of the wedge component homologies. Finally, we generalize our characterization to cactus graphs with arbitrary edge weights and orientations. Our analytical results give insight into how our method captures temporal information in its asymmetry, producing a persistence framework robust to noise and sensitive to dynamical structure.",

The theory, supplemented with physically motivated tip conditions, is applied to the mixed mode-I/mode-II loading of a finite straight crack in an infinite isotropic plate. Using complex-analytic techniques, it is shown that the resulting stress and strain fields remain bounded up to the crack tips for nearly all admissible parameter values. Combined with previous results for mode-III loading, the analysis demonstrates that linearized surface-substrate models incorporating surface strain-gradient elasticity eliminate crack-tip singularities across all principal modes of far-field loading.",

The Albertson-Berman conjecture, which is open since 1979, states that $a(G) \\geq \\frac{n}{2}$ for all simple planar graphs $G$. We show that the version of this problem for multigraphs (allowing parallel edges) is easily reduced to the problem about the independence number of simple planar graphs. Specifically, we prove that $a(M) \\geq \\frac{n}{4}$ for all planar multigraphs $M$ and that this lower bound is tight. Then, we study the case when the number of pairs of vertices with parallel edges, which we denote by $k$, is small. In particular, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \\geq \\frac{2}{5}n-\\frac{k}{10}$ and that the Albertson-Berman conjecture for simple planar graphs, assuming that it holds, would imply the lower bound $a(M) \\geq \\frac{n-k}{2}$ for planar multigraphs, which would be better than the general lower bound when $k$ is small. Finally, we study the variant of the problem where the plane multigraphs are prohibited from having $2$-faces, which is the main non-trivial problem that we introduce in this article. For that variant without $2$-faces, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \\geq \\frac{3}{10}n+\\frac{7}{30}$ and give a construction of an infinite sequence of multigraphs with $a(M)=\\frac{3}{7}n+\\frac{4}{7}$.",

    "abstract": "Given a graph $F$, a hypergraph is called a Berge-$F$ if it can be obtained by expanding each edge of $F$ into a hyperedge containing it. Let $M_{k}$ denote the matching of size $k$. Kang, Ni, and Shan [12] determined the Tur\u00e1n number of Berge-$M_k$. Our main result shows that if an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ on $n$ vertices has nearly as many edges as the extremal in their theorem without containing $M_k$, then $H$ must be structurally close to certain well-specified graphs. Meanwhile, our result also implies several stability results, such as the stability version of the well-known Erd\u0151s-Gallai theorem (Erd\u0151s and Gallai, 1959 [5]).",

The analysis applies to curves beyond the nodal case and is not restricted to plane curves, encompassing curves lying on smooth projective surfaces as well as families with more general isolated singularities. Using deformation-theoretic and residue-theoretic methods, we describe how the infinitesimal period map decomposes into local contributions supported at singular points, together with global constraints arising from the geometry of the normalization. While nodal singularities give rise to nontrivial rank-one contributions, other singularities may contribute only through higher-order local data or may be invisible at the infinitesimal level. As a consequence, we obtain sharp criteria for maximal infinitesimal variation in terms of numerical invariants of the curve, notably when the number of nodes satisfies the inequality $\u03b4\\ge g$, where $g$ denotes the genus of the normalization.\n  We extend these results to curves on very general surfaces in projective three-space, showing that maximal variation persists on Picard-rank-one surfaces but fails for sufficiently large genus in the presence of higher ADE singularities.

We develop a general framework for these parameters by associating each graph with a $k$-uniform hypergraph that encodes its geodesic structure. We then establish basic bounds and monotonicity properties, and introduce a notion of $k,d$-perfection extending the classical theory of perfect graphs. Exact formulas are obtained for the $k,d$-chromatic number of paths and cycles. In particular, all paths are $k,d$-perfect for all parameters, while cycles admit a complete classification of $k,d$-perfection that recovers the classical case when $k=2$ and exhibits new periodic and finite-exception behavior for $k\\ge3$. We further investigate the interaction between $k,d$-invariants and graph powers, showing that while the $k=2$ case reduces to graph powers in a straightforward way, substantially different behavior arises for higher values of $k$, even for powers of paths.",

Since $Q_{p,q}(t)$ is even and satisfies $Q_{p,q}(0)\\neq 0$, any such $5+5$ splitting is necessarily symmetric, meaning that it can be written in the normal form $Q_{p,q}(t)=R_{p,q}(t)\\cdot (-R_{p,q}(-t))$. After a weighted normalization reducing to a one-parameter polynomial $Q_r(u)$ with $r=p/q\\in\\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$, coefficient comparison and elimination via resultants show that a $5+5$ splitting forces the existence of a rational point on an explicitly defined plane curve $F(r,a)=0$.

    "abstract": "Simulations of the dynamics generated by partial differential equations (PDEs) provide approximate, numerical solutions to initial value problems. Such simulations are ubiquitous in scientific computing, but the correctness of the results is usually not guaranteed. We propose a new method for the rigorous integration of parabolic PDEs, i.e., the derivation of rigorous and explicit error bounds between the numerically obtained approximate solution and the exact one, which is then proven to exist over the entire time interval considered. These guaranteed error bounds are obtained a posteriori, using a fixed point reformulation based on a piece-wise in time constant approximation of the linearization around the numerical solution. Our setup leads to relatively simple-to-understand estimates, which has several advantages. Most critically, it allows us to optimize various aspects of the proof, and in particular to provide an adaptive time-stepping strategy. In case the solution converges to a stable hyperbolic equilibrium, we are also able to prove this convergence, applying our rigorous integrator with a final, infinitely long timestep. We showcase the ability of our method to rigorously integrate over relatively long time intervals, and to capture non-trivial dynamics, via examples on the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We expect that the simplicity and efficiency of the approach will enable generalization to a wide variety of other parabolic PDEs, as well as applications to boundary value problems.",

    "abstract": "Node coloring is the task of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, while using as few colors as possible. It is the most widely studied instance of graph coloring and of central importance in graph theory; major results include the Four Color Theorem and work on the Hadwiger-Nelson Problem. As an abstraction of classical combinatorial optimization tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, it is also rich in practical applications. Here, we focus on a relaxed version, approximate $k$-coloring, which is the task of assigning at most $k$ colors to the nodes of a graph such that the number of edges whose vertices have the same color is approximately minimized. While classical approaches leverage mathematical programming or SAT solvers, recent studies have explored the use of machine learning. We follow this route and explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node coloring. We first present an optimized differentiable algorithm that improves a prior approach by Schuetz et al. with orthogonal node feature initialization and a loss function that penalizes conflicting edges more heavily when their endpoints have higher degree; the latter inspired by the classical result that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if its $k$-core is $k$-colorable. Next, we introduce a lightweight greedy local search algorithm and show that it may be improved by recursively computing a $(k-1)$-coloring to use as a warm start. We then show that applying such recursive warm starts to the GNN approach leads to further improvements. Numerical experiments on a range of different graph structures show that while the local search algorithms perform best on small inputs, the GNN exhibits superior performance at scale. The recursive warm start may be of independent interest beyond graph coloring for local search methods for combinatorial optimization.",

For strictly subquadratic and entropic regularisation, the estimates improve to interior $C^1$ and $C^2$ estimates for the transport-like map and the potentials, respectively.

Furthermore, we examine the special **uniform-memory** case \\(\u03b1=\u03b2\\equiv1\\), proving that \\(\\mathscr{V}_{\u03b1,\u03b2}[x](t)\\) **asymptotically recovers** the classical derivative \\(\\dot{x}(0)\\) as \\(t \\to 0^{+}\\), thereby ensuring consistency with standard calculus. The analysis is supported by self-contained appendices providing necessary technical tools. The framework developed here offers a well-defined mathematical object for describing memory-dependent dynamics, with potential utility in formulating and analyzing evolution equations that feature adaptively weighted historical information.",

    "abstract": "This paper bridges this critical gap by providing a systematic examination of the beamforming codebook technology, i.e., precoding matrix indicator (PMI), in the 5G NR from theoretical, standardization, and implementation perspectives. We begin by introducing the background of beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and the signaling procedures for codebook-based beamforming in practical 5G systems. Then, we establish the fundamentals of regular codebooks and port-selection codebooks in 3GPP standards. Next, we provide rigorous technical analysis of 3GPP codebook evolution spanning Releases 15-18, with particular focus on: 1) We elucidate the core principles underlying codebook design, 2) provide clear physical interpretations for each symbolic variable in the codebook formulas, summarized in tabular form, and 3) offer intuitive visual illustrations to explain how codebook parameters convey information. These essential pedagogical elements are almost entirely absent in the often-obscure standardization documents. Through mathematical modeling, performance benchmarking, feedback comparisons, and scenario-dependent applicability analysis, we provide researchers and engineers with a unified understanding of beamforming codebooks in real-world systems. Furthermore, we identify future directions and other beamforming scenarios for ongoing research and development efforts. This work serves as both an informative tutorial and a guidance for future research, facilitating more effective collaboration between academia and industry in advancing wireless communication technologies.",

    "abstract": "The Fueter-Sce theorem is one of the most important results in hypercomplex analysis, providing a two-step procedure for constructing axially monogenic functions starting from holomorphic functions of one variable. In the first step, the so-called slice operator is applied to holomorphic functions of one variable, producing the class of slice hyperholomorphic functions. The second step yields the class of axially monogenic functions by applying the pointwise differential operator Delta_{n+1}^{(n-1)/2}, with n odd, known as the Fueter-Sce map. The significance of the Fueter-Sce theorem also lies in the fact that it induces two spectral theories corresponding to the function classes it generates.\n  Over the years, factorizations of the Fueter-Sce map have been studied to identify the intermediate spaces that arise between slice hyperholomorphic functions and axially monogenic functions. Until now, only certain factorizations of the Fueter-Sce map have been considered. In this paper, our goal is to determine the most general factorizations of the Fueter-Sce map and to apply these differential operators to the Cauchy kernel of slice hyperholomorphic functions.",

The dynamical fields, defined on a manifold of dimension $n+1$, are the space-time metric, a scalar field known as the dilaton function, and a two-form known as the $B$-field. We develop a generalisation of the Lorenz gauge which, applied to the $B$-field (and combined with a suitable gauge condition breaking diffeomorphism invariance), renders the system a wave equation with principal symbol given by the (dynamical) metric. Given initial data, we construct a development satisfying the gauge conditions. We show that all other developments are (in the appropriate sense) related to this development by a diffeomorphism, establishing geometric uniqueness. The existence of the MGHD follows then by a famous result by Choquet-Bruhat and Geroch.\n  In showing existence and geometric uniqueness of developments, we follow an approach developed in detail by Ringstr\u00f6m for the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field. In a preliminary section, we present a formulation which is disentangled from the specific assumptions made on the matter, so that adaptation to other systems is straightforward.",

Notably, this demonstrates for the first time that the contour integral method can be extended to the regularized setting (including the case $k_r=1$), thereby overcoming a limitation of previous approaches. Our results not only provide explicit parity relations at arbitrary depths but also lay the groundwork for extending this technique to other variants of multiple zeta values.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases remain a major public-health threat, and the effective control of mosquito populations requires sustained household participation in removing breeding sites. While environmental drivers of mosquito oscillations have been extensively studied, the influence of spontaneous household decision-making on the dynamics of mosquito populations remains poorly understood. We introduce a game-theoretic model in which the fraction of households performing breeding site control evolves through imitation dynamics driven by perceived risks. Household behavior regulates the carrying capacity of the aquatic mosquito stage, creating a feedback between control actions and mosquito population growth. For a simplified model with constant payoffs, we characterize four locally stable equilibria, corresponding to full or no household control and the presence or absence of mosquito populations. When the perceived risk of not controlling breeding sites depends on mosquito prevalence, the system admits an additional equilibrium with partial household engagement. We derive conditions under which this equilibrium undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, yielding sustained oscillations arising solely from the interaction between mosquito abundance and household behavior. Numerical simulations and parameter explorations further describe the amplitude and phase properties of these oscillatory regimes.",

Let $A=\\bigoplus_{g\\in G} A_g$ be its decomposition into homogeneous components. Assume that for every $n$-tuple $(g_1,\\dots,g_n)$ in $G$, there exist $a_{i}\\in A_{g_{i}}$ with $a_1\\cdots a_n\\neq 0$, and that for each $g$,$h\\in G$ there exists a scalar $\u03b2(g,h)\\in K^{\\ast}$ such that $a_ga_h=\u03b2(g,h)a_ha_g$.

The lower order terms allow us to prove that the stationary points of the Ricci-harmonic flow are exactly torsion-free $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structures on compact manifolds. We study various analytic and geometric properties of the flow. We show that the flow has short-time existence and uniqueness on compact manifolds starting with an arbitrary $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structure and prove global Shi-type estimates. We also prove a modified local Shi-type estimates for the flow which assume bounds on the initial derivatives of the Riemann curvature tensor and the torsion but give uniform bounds on these quantities for all times. We prove a compactness theorem for the solutions of the flow and use it to prove that the Ricci-harmonic flow exists as long as the velocity of the flow remains bounded. We also study Ricci-harmonic solitons where we prove that there are no compact expanding solitons and the only steady solitons are torsion-free. We derive an analog of Hamilton's identity for gradient Ricci-harmonic solitons and prove some integral identities for the solitons. Finally, we prove a version of the Taylor series expansion for Spin(7)-structures and use it to derive the Ricci-harmonic flow of Spin(7)-structures.",

    "abstract": "The basis number of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that the cycle space of $G$ is generated by a family of cycles using each edge at most $k$ times. A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number.\n  Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Boja\u0144czyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture.\n  Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c>0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$.",

    "title": "Fundamental Tradeoffs for ISAC Multiple Access in Finite-Blocklength Regime",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the fundamental communication--sensing tradeoffs of uplink dual-functional integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) multiple access under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. Unlike conventional asymptotic analyses, we explicitly account for the limitations under FBL constraints imposed by short packets and low-latency transmission. By examining the unbiased channel state sensing estimator, we establish a geometric decomposition of the sensing error, indicating that it is jointly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio and the correlation structure of the information codebook. This insight reveals how cross-correlation among active users in the codebook geometry fundamentally constrains dual-functional ISAC performance. Consequently, we derive achievability and converse bounds that characterize the tradeoff between communication code rate and sensing accuracy in the FBL regime, with the converse further bounded by Shannon capacity. Moreover, by treating channel state sensing as a high-level sensing objective, a universal Cram\u00e9r--Rao bound is derived to link channel estimation accuracy to practical sensing parameters. Examples of parameter sensing are also provided based on 3GPP standard. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of blocklength, antenna dimensions, and sensing requirements.",

The variable projection (VarPro) method provides an efficient approach for solving such problems by eliminating linear variables and reducing the problem to a smaller, nonlinear one. In this work, we extend VarPro to solve minimization problems containing a differentiable regularization term on the nonlinear parameters, along with a general-form Tikhonov regularization term on the linear variables. Furthermore, we develop a quasi-Newton method for solving the resulting reduced problem, and provide a local convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions, establishing conditions for superlinear or quadratic convergence. For large-scale settings, we introduce an inexact LSQR-based variant and prove its local convergence despite inner-solve and Hessian approximations. Numerical experiments on semi-blind deblurring show that parameter regularization prevents degenerate no-blur solutions and that the proposed methods achieve accurate reconstructions, with the inexact variant offering a favorable accuracy-cost tradeoff consistent with the theory.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the value function of Bolza problems governed by stochastic difference equations, with particular emphasis on the convex non-anticipative case. Our goal is to provide some insights on the structure of the subdiferential of the value function. In particular, we establish a connection between the evolution of the subgradients of the value function and a stochastic difference equation of Hamiltonian type. This result can be seen as a transposition of the method of characteristics, introduced by Rockafellar and Wolenski in the 2000s, to the stochastic discrete-time setting. Similarly as done in the literature for the deterministic case, the analysis is based on a duality approach. For this reason we study first a dual representation for the value function in terms of the value function of a dual problem, which is a pseudo Bolza problem. The main difference with the deterministic case is that (due to the non-anticipativity) the symmetry between the Bolza problem and its dual is no longer valid. This in turn implies that ensuring the existence of minimizers for the Bolza problem (which is a key point for establishing the method of characteristics) is not as simple as in the deterministic case, and it should be addressed differently. To complete the exposition, we study the existence of minimizers for a particular class of Bolza problems governed by linear stochastic difference equations, the so-called linear-convex optimal control problems.",

While effective in practice, deterministic convergence analyses of greedy-type algorithms are often restrictive and difficult to verify. We propose a stochastic framework in which greedy-type methods are formulated as continuous- time Markov processes on the space of configurations. This viewpoint enables convergence analysis in expectation and in probability under mild structural assumptions on the error functional and the transition kernel. For global error functionals, we derive explicit convergence rates, including logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay, depending on an abstract improvement condition. As a pedagogical example, we study stochastic greedy sampling for one-dimensional piece- wise linear interpolation and prove exponential convergence of the $L^1$-interpolation error for $C^2$- functions.

    "abstract": "The high directionality of wave propagation at millimeter-wave (mmWave) carrier frequencies results in only a small number of significant transmission paths between user equipments and the basestation (BS). This sparse nature of wave propagation is revealed in the beamspace domain, which is traditionally obtained by taking the spatial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across a uniform linear antenna array at the BS, where each DFT output is associated with a distinct beam. In recent years, beamspace processing has emerged as a promising technique to reduce baseband complexity and power consumption in all-digital massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies. However, it remains unclear whether the DFT is the optimal sparsifying transform for finite-dimensional antenna arrays. In this paper, we extend the framework of Zhai et al. for complete dictionary learning via $\\ell^4$-norm maximization to the complex case in order to learn new sparsifying transforms. We provide a theoretical foundation for $\\ell^4$-norm maximization and propose two suitable learning algorithms. We then utilize these algorithms (i) to assess the optimality of the DFT for sparsifying channel vectors theoretically and via simulations and (ii) to learn improved sparsifying transforms for real-world and synthetically generated channel vectors.",

    "abstract": "The graph alignment problem aims to identify the vertex correspondence between two correlated graphs. Most existing studies focus on the scenario in which the two graphs share the same vertex set. However, in many real-world applications, such as computer vision, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, the task often involves locating a small graph pattern within a larger graph. Existing graph alignment algorithms and analysis cannot directly address these scenarios because they are not designed to identify the specific subset of vertices where the small graph pattern resides within the larger graph. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the subgraph alignment problem, which seeks to recover both the vertex set and/or the vertex correspondence of a small graph pattern embedded in a larger graph. In the special case where the small graph pattern is an induced subgraph of the larger graph and both the vertex set and correspondence are to be recovered, the problem reduces to the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete in the worst case. In this paper, we formally formulate the subgraph alignment problem by proposing the Erdos-Renyi subgraph pair model together with some appropriate recovery criterion. We then establish almost-tight information-theoretic results for the subgraph alignment problem and present some novel approaches for the analysis.",

    "abstract": "Previous work of the author and N. Reshetikhin defines an invariant $\\operatorname{Z}_{N}^\u03c8(K, \u03c1, \u03bc)$ of a knot $K$, a representation $\u03c1: \u03c0_{1}(S^{3} \\setminus K) \\to \\operatorname{SL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$, and a logarithm $\u03bc$ of a meridian eigenvalue of $\u03c1$. It can be interpreted as a geometric twist of the Kasahev invariant or as a quantization of the $\\operatorname{SL}(\\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons invariant and is defined using a discrete state-sum involving quantum dilogarithms. In this paper we show how to express $\\operatorname{Z}_{N}^\u03c8(K, \u03c1, \u03bc)$ as a sum over contour integrals in a space parametrizing hyperbolic structures on the knot complement. Such integral presentations are an important step in determining the asymptotics of quantum invariants as predicted by the Volume Conjecture. We discuss this perspective and the remaining obstacles to establishing exponential growth of $\\operatorname{Z}_{N}^\u03c8$.",

We prove that there are non-selfadjoint operator algebras with a one-point lattice in two ways: as an explicit subalgebra of the C*-algebra of a universal contraction, and via a direct limit construction inspired by the work of Kirchberg and Wassermann for operator systems. We also establish that the C*-envelope need not have an immediate successor C*-cover in the lattice, and that a semi-Dirichlet non-selfadjoint operator algebra never has a one-point lattice.",

    "abstract": "We present a high-order accurate fully discrete numerical scheme for solving Initial Boundary Value Problems (IBVPs) within the Continuous Galerkin (CG)-based Finite Element framework. Both the spatial and time approximation in Summation-By-Parts (SBP) form are considered here. The initial and boundary conditions are imposed weakly using the Simultaneous Approximation Term (SAT) technique. The resulting SBP-SAT formulation yields an energy estimate in terms of the initial and external boundary data, leading to an energy-stable discretization in both space and time. The proposed method is evaluated numerically using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS). The scheme achieves super-convergence in both spatial and temporal direction with accuracy $\\mathcal{O}(p+2)$ for $p\\geq 2$, where $p$ refers to the degree of the Lagrange basis. In an application case, we show that the fully discrete formulation efficiently captures space-time variations even on coarse meshes, demonstrating the method's computational effectiveness.",

    "title": "On the effects of protection zone and directed population flux in prey-predator dynamics",
    "abstract": "We study a spatial predator-prey model in which prey can enter a protection zone (refuge) inaccessible to predators, while predators exhibit directed movement toward prey-rich regions. The directed movement is modeled by a far-sighted population flux motivated by classical movement rules, in contrast to the more commonly analyzed near-sighted chemotaxis-type mechanisms. We first establish local-in-time well-posedness for the corresponding nonstationary problem under Neumann boundary conditions, despite the discontinuity induced by the refuge interface. We then investigate the stationary problem, focusing on how the coexistence states emerge and organize globally in parameter space. In particular, we identify the bifurcation threshold for positive steady states from semitrivial predator-only equilibria, and describe the global continuation of the resulting branches. Our analysis reveals that strong directed movement can induce turning-point structures and multiplicity of coexistence steady states, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between spatial protection and predator movement behavior.",

    "title": "Refinements of Jensen's Inequality for Twice-Differentiable Convex Functions with Bounded Hessian",
    "abstract": "Jensen's inequality, attributed to Johan Jensen -- a Danish mathematician and engineer noted for his contributions to the theory of functions -- is a ubiquitous result in convex analysis, providing a fundamental lower bound for the expectation of a convex function. In this paper, we establish rigorous refinements of this inequality specifically for twice-differentiable functions with bounded Hessians. By utilizing Taylor expansions with integral remainders, we tried to bridge the gap between classical variance-based bounds and higher-precision estimates. We also discover explicit error terms governed by Gruss-type inequalities, allowing for the incorporation of skewness and kurtosis into the bound. Using these new theoretical tools, we improve upon existing estimates for the Shannon entropy of continuous distributions and the ergodic capacity of Rayleigh fading channels, demonstrating the practical efficacy of our refinements.",

Numerical experiments on this framework, which inherently includes automatic parameter selection, delivers GVD as a robust, self-tuning, and superior solution for reliable image decomposition.",
