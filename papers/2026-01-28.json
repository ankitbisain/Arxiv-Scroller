    "title": "On the Number of Almost Empty Monochromatic Triangles",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of counting almost empty monochromatic triangles in colored planar point sets, that is, triangles whose vertices are all assigned the same color and that contain only a few interior points. Specifically, we show that any $c$-coloring of a set of $n$ points in the plane in general position (that is, no three on a line) contains $\u03a9(n^2)$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-1$ interior points and $\u03a9(n^{\\frac{4}{3}})$ monochromatic triangles with at most $c-2$ interior points, for any fixed $c \\geq 2$. The latter, in particular, generalizes the result of Pach and T\u00f3th (2013) on the number of monochromatic empty triangles in 2-colored point sets, to the setting of multiple colors and monochromatic triangles with a few interior points. We also derive the limiting value of the expected number of triangles with $s$ interior points in random point sets, for any integer $s \\geq 0$. As a result, we obtain the expected number of monochromatic triangles with at most $s$ interior points in random colorings of random point sets.",

    "title": "Collaborative Decision-Making and Optimal Utilization of Pathfinding Flights during Convective Weather",
    "abstract": "Air traffic operations are strongly influenced by convective weather, and one common response is pathfinder operations, in which a designated aircraft tests the viability of weather-impacted airspace and routes. Despite relatively routine use in practice, how pathfinder operations evolve under uncertainty and how the pathfinder decision-making process unfolds are largely treated as exogenous. Addressing this gap requires jointly modeling weather-driven system accessibility, flight responses to pathfinder offers, and the sequencing of those offers to improve outcomes. We develop a unified analytical framework that connects weather-driven system state transitions, flight acceptance decisions, and the sequencing of pathfinder offers. We first construct a four-state Markov chain to model stochastic closure and reopening of exit points, or fixes, out of the terminal departure airspace surrounding a major airport, pathfinder selection, and pathfinding execution, and analyze its steady-state behavior to characterize long-term capacity and delay implications. We introduce utility-based decision models for flights, air traffic control (ATC), and dispatchers, and analyze worst-case collective rejection to quantify system vulnerability under selfless behavior and uncertainty. Finally, we formulate optimization problems that model ATC-initiated and dispatcher-initated pathfinder offers, with the goal of optimizing the sequence of pathfinder offers. Using a discrete event simulation for a major US airport, we show that ATC- and dispatcher-driven objectives lead to distinct, near real-time sequencing strategies, providing the first formal decision models for pathfinder operations under weather uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a hybrid reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for turbulent incompressible flows on collocated finite volume grids. The methodology employs the \"discretize-then-project\" consistent flux strategy, which ensures mass conservation and pressure-velocity coupling without requiring auxiliary stabilization like boundary control or pressure stabilization techniques. However, because standard Galerkin projection fails to yield physically consistent results for the turbulent viscosity field, a hybrid strategy is adopted: velocity and pressure are resolved via intrusive projection, while the turbulent viscosity is reconstructed using a non-intrusive data-driven closure. We evaluate three neural network architectures, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Transformers, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to model the temporal evolution of the viscosity coefficients. Validated against a 3D Large Eddy Simulation of a lid-driven cavity, the LSTM-based closure demonstrates superior performance in capturing transient dynamics, achieving relative errors of 0.7\\% for velocity and 4\\% for turbulent viscosity. The resulting framework effectively combines the mathematical rigor of the consistent flux formulation with the adaptability of deep learning for turbulence modeling.",

We derive a hydrodynamic limit when the number of immature compartments goes to infinity obtaining a partial differential equations system with boundary conditions, modelling hematopoiesis as a continuum. We assume that proliferation and differentiation are regulated and let the corresponding rates depend on the number of mature cells. This leads us to model the dynamics of the population by a Markov process in continuous time and discrete space, which does not satisfy the branching property. We prove the convergence in law of the stem and mature cells population size processes and of the empirical measures of the immature cells dynamics, conveniently rescaled, to the unique triplet involving coupled functions and a measure, which are solutions of a deterministic measure valued equation with boundary dynamics. The cell differentiation induces a transport term in space and the main difficulty comes from the boundary effects coming from stem and mature cells.

In an enormous effort Kawarabayashi, Thomas, and Wollan proved a similar statement with explicit (and single-exponential in $|V(H)|$) bounds.

Moreover, we provide a more refined version of the GMST focussed exclusively on excluding, instead of a single graph, grid-like graphs that are minor-universal for a given set of surfaces.

In the proof, we prove the asymptotic equivalence between the genuine likelihood and the much simpler Euler-type quasi-likelihood. Furthermore, we propose a simple moment-based method to estimate the parameters of the driving stable L\u00e9vy process, which serves as an initial estimator for numerical search of the (quasi-)likelihood, reducing the computational burden of the optimization to a large extent.

Diagnosing such failures is naturally an evaluative problem: given a fixed model and a grounding, can one determine whether they are structurally compatible, and if not, identify the nature and localization of the obstruction?\n  In this work, we introduce a sheaf-theoretic and spectral framework for evaluating structural inconsistency as a \\emph{relative} phenomenon. A model is represented by a cellular sheaf $\\mathcal F$ on a cell complex, together with a morphism into a grounding sheaf $\\mathcal W$ encoding admissible global behavior. Failure of compatibility is captured by the mapping cone of this morphism, whose cohomology computes the relative groups $H^*(K;\\mathcal F,\\mathcal W)$ and separates intrinsic obstructions from inconsistencies induced by the grounding.\n  Beyond exact cohomological classification, we develop \\emph{spectral witnesses} derived from regular and mapping-cone Laplacians. The spectra of these operators provide computable, quantitative indicators of inconsistency, encoding both robustness and spatial localization through spectral gaps, integrated energies, and eigenmode support. These witnesses enable comparison of distinct inconsistency mechanisms in fixed systems without learning, optimization, or modification of the underlying representation.\n  The proposed framework is domain-agnostic and applies to a broad class of structured models where feasibility is enforced locally but evaluated globally.",

Exact reconstruction formulas are derived for complex-valued graph signals, together with sufficient and computable conditions guaranteeing stable invertibility. The associated families of windowed graph Fourier atoms are shown to form frames for the space of graph signals. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world graphs confirm exact reconstruction up to machine precision and demonstrate improved stability and vertex-frequency localization compared to single-window constructions, particularly on irregular graph topologies.",

    "abstract": "Vehicular platooning refers to coordinated and close movement of vehicular users (VUs) traveling together along a common route segment, offering strategic benefits such as reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, and improved traffic flow. {Highways offer a natural setting for platooning due to extended travel distances, yet their potential remains underexplored, particularly in terms of communication and connectivity. Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance.",

Further, we generalise the work of Mosher, proving the existence of quasiisometric sections for a given short exact sequence of hyperbolic TDLC groups.

However, this promise is fundamentally undermined by a cascaded backscattering link that suffers from severe double fading and is exquisitely sensitive to geometric misalignment. This article tackles this geometric bottleneck by integrating movable antenna systems (MAS) at the transceiver side. MAS provides real-time, controllable spatial degrees of freedom through sub-wavelength antenna repositioning, enabling active reconfiguration of the cascaded channel without modifying passive tags or consuming additional spectrum. We position this solution within a unified ISAC-backscatter communication-B-ISAC evolution, describe the resulting MAS-assisted B-ISAC architecture and operating principles, and demonstrate its system-level gains through comparative analysis and numerical results. Finally, we showcase the potential of this geometry-adaptive paradigm across key IoT application scenarios, pointing toward future motion-aware wireless networks.",

Classical analyses, beginning with Lamb's representation of the half-space response, typically assume an infinite plate and rely on diagonalization of the soil operator via the continuous Hankel transform. For a plate of finite radius $R$, however, both traction and displacement are supported only on $0 \\le r \\le R$, leading to the spatially truncated Lamb operator \\[ \\mathscr{M}(\u03c9) = \u03c7_{[0,R]} \\, T(\u03c9)\\, \u03c7_{[0,R]}, \\] where $T(\u03c9)$ is the Hankel multiplier involving the Rayleigh denominator $\u03a9(\u03be,\u03c9)$. Truncation destroys the diagonal structure of $T(\u03c9)$ and introduces real-axis singularities associated with the Rayleigh pole, in addition to square-root branch points at $\u03be= k_T$ and $\u03be= k_L$. We represent the action of $\\mathscr{M}(\u03c9)$ on a finite-disk Bessel basis $\\{ \u03c6_n(r) = A_{1,n} J_0(\u03bb_n r) + A_{2,n} I_0(\u03bb_n r)\\},$ which satisfies the free-edge boundary conditions of the plate, and derive explicit expressions for the resulting matrix elements. These involve integrals of the Lamb kernel evaluated as Cauchy principal values, with residue contributions corresponding to radiation damping in the half-space. The resulting operator matrix is dense but spectrally convergent. Its inversion yields a complete frequency-domain solution for finite-radius plates. The analysis reproduces Chen et al.'s finite-radius experiments for small $R$, approaches the infinite-radius limit as $R \\to \\infty$, and quantifies finite-radius corrections. To our knowledge, this is the first exact operator-level treatment of finite-radius plate-half-space interaction that retains the full nonlocal Lamb kernel.",

As a corollary we prove that the essential minimum can be attained by sequences of algebraic integers.\n  Recent results by A. Smith and B. Orloski--N.

We establish an extension of this characterization to measures with non necessarily compact support.

In this work, we introduce a mathematical strategy to analyze the nonlinear stability of RK schemes that may not necessarily belong to the SSP class. With this approach, we mathematically demonstrate that there are time integration schemes outside the class of SSP schemes that can maintain entropy stability and positivity of density and pressure for the Lax-Friedrichs discretization, and Total Variation Diminishing stability for the first-order upwind and the second-order MUSCL schemes. As a result, for these problems, a broader range of RK methods, including the classical fourth-order, four-stage RK scheme, can be used while the numerical integration remains stable.

In this work, we propose an iterative belief-combining procedure that computes symbol-wise a posteriori probabilities by propagating trace-wise inferences via message passing. We prove that, upon convergence, our method achieves the same reconstruction performance as joint maximum a posteriori estimation, while reducing the complexity to quadratic in the number of traces. This performance equivalence is validated using a real-world dataset of clustered short-strand DNA reads.",

    "abstract": "A physically consistent framework for modeling materials with saturating deformation, such as elastomers and biological tissues, is provided by strain-limiting elasticity. Fundamental limitations of classical elasticity are addressed through the enforcement of bounded strains; however, significant challenges for data-driven learning are posed by the strong nonlinearity of these laws. In this work, an interpretable hybrid constitutive modeling framework integrating strain-limiting elasticity (SLE) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) is proposed to balance mechanical admissibility with data-driven flexibility. The dominant nonlinear response is captured by the SLE backbone, while smooth residual corrections are learned exclusively via a KAN. Essential mechanical principles-including symmetry, monotonicity, and bounded strain-are embedded directly into the model structure to ensure physical admissibility. The framework is assessed on synthetic benchmarks, where near-exact recovery is achieved in smooth regimes and consistency is retained under sharp transitions. Application to Treloar's rubber elasticity data demonstrates systematic improvement in stress-stretch agreement while preserving explicit strain limits. A regime-based analysis reveals a transparent trade-off between data fidelity and mechanical admissibility, demonstrating that deviations arise from deliberately imposed physical restrictions rather than unconstrained model expressivity. This SLE-KAN framework offers a robust, physics-consistent alternative to black-box neural networks for constitutive modeling.",

    "abstract": "The search for a closed-form expression of the $n$-th prime number, $p_n$, has long oscillated between the rigid determinism of analytic functions and the apparent randomness of local distributions. This paper explores three different approaches to $p_n$. The first one formalizes an analytical identity for $p_{n}$ based on a harmonic summation filtered by a M\u00f6bius-derived coprimality indicator. Unlike Gandhi's 1971 identity, which employs a geometric density and logarithmic extraction, this formula operates through a discrete summation over the range defined by Bertrand's postulate. In the second one, we refine the ``harmonic resonance'' model, which posits that primes emerge as spectral nodes from von Mangoldt oscillations. Third, we adopt a ``survival dynamics'' approach, inspired by Mertens' theorems, treating prime spacing as an evolutionary growth process. By bridging these perspectives, we offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the transition from asymptotic trends to discrete arithmetic realities.",

By a result of Nadirashvili, El Soufi, and Ilias, critical metrics for the $k$-th normalized Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue functional $\\bar\u03bb_k$ in a conformal class correspond to harmonic maps to spheres. In this paper we construct certain $\\mathbb S^1$-equivariant harmonic maps $\\mathbb T^2\\to\\mathbb S^3$.

This refines a recent result by Karpukhin that answers a question by El Soufi, Ilias, and Ros. Also, we are able to show that if a rotationally invariant metric on a rectangular torus is maximal for $\\bar\u03bb_1$ in its conformal class, then it is $\\mathbb S^1$-equivariant and coincides (up to a scalar factor) with the above metric.

At the microscopic layer, a two variant quasispecies (master and mutant genomes with packaged virions) evolves on a fast timescale. At the macroscopic layer, two infectious classes (master- and mutant-infected), susceptible, recovered, and deceased individuals evolve slowly. The two scales are connected through transmission rates that depend on instantaneous virion abundance and through prevalence-weighted effective replication rates. Exploiting the timescale separation, we formalize a coarse-grained slow-fast closure: the genome-virion subsystem rapidly relaxes to quasi-steady states that parameterize time-varying transmission in the slow epidemiological system. This yields an integrated expression for the basic reproduction number and sharp inequalities that delineate coexistence versus exclusion. A key prediction is a context-dependent error threshold that shifts with the prevalence ratio, enabling transient pseudo-error catastrophes driven by epidemic composition rather than intrinsic fidelity. Linearization reveals parameter regions with damped oscillations arising solely from the microscopic-macroscopic feedback. Two illustrative extremes bracket the model's behavior: an avirulent strongly immunizing strain that benignly replaces the master, and a hypervirulent weakly immunizing that self-limits via host depletion and collapses transmission. This framework yields testable signatures linking viral load, incidence, and within-host composition.",

    "abstract": "Timelike Liouville field theory (also known as imaginary Liouville theory or imaginary Gaussian multiplicative chaos) is expected to describe two-dimensional quantum gravity in a positive-curvature regime, but its path integral is not a probability measure and rigorous exact computations are currently available only in the charge-neutral (integer screening) case. In this paper we show that at the special coupling $b=1/\\sqrt{2}$, the Coulomb-gas expansion of the timelike path integral becomes explicitly computable beyond charge neutrality. The reason is that the $n$-fold integrals generated by the interaction acquire a Vandermonde/determinantal structure at $b=1/\\sqrt{2}$, which allows exact evaluation in terms of classical special functions. We derive Mellin-Barnes type representations (involving the Barnes $G$-function and, in a three-point case, Gauss hypergeometric functions) for the zero- and one-point functions, for an antipodal two-point function, and for a three-point function with a resonant insertion $\u03b1_2=b$. We then address the subtle zero-mode integration: after a Gaussian regularization we obtain an explicit renormalized partition function $C(1/\\sqrt{2},\u03bc)=e(4\u03c0\\sqrt2 \u03bc)^{-1}$, identify distributional limits in the physically relevant regime $\u03b1_j=\\frac{1}{2}Q+\\mathrm{i} P_j$, and compare with the Hankel-contour prescription recently proposed in the physics literature.

Furthermore, to address the limited universality of current continuous time regime-switching RL algorithms (often restricted to the EMV framework), this study focuses on continuous-time q-learning for Markov regime-switching systems based on Tsallis entropy, aiming for a more universally applicable continuous-time RL method. We establish the martingale characterization of the q-function under Tsallis entropy for continuous-time Markov regime-switching systems.

In the elliptic regime this system reduces to a forced complex Burgers equation for a scalar spectral parameter encoding the structure coefficients. We identify a rigidity condition under which the transport becomes conservative, and show that in this regime the generalized Cauchy Riemann operator satisfies a Leibniz rule and admits a factorization of the associated second order operator into first order components. As a consequence, classical tools of planar complex analysis, including Cauchy Pompeiu type formulas, integral representations, and elliptic second order operators, reappear in a variable coefficient setting with explicit structure. The theory is developed at the level of direct computation, emphasizing transparency of the integrability mechanism and the interplay between transport dynamics, rigidity, and function theory.",

We investigate the large-$n$ asymptotic behaviour of the Ewens-Pitman random partition in the nonstandard regime $\u03b8=\u03bbn$ with $\u03bb>0$, establishing joint fluctuation results for the total number of blocks $K_n^{\\{n\\}}$ and the counts $K_{r,n}^{\\{n\\}}$ of blocks of sizes $r=1,\\dots,d$, for fixed $d\\in\\mathbb{N}$. In particular, for $\u03b1\\in[0,1)$ and $\u03b8=\u03bbn$, our main result provides a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the $(d+1)$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{K}_{d,n}^{\\{n\\}} = \\bigl(K_n^{\\{n\\}}, K_{1,n}^{\\{n\\}}, \\dots, K_{d,n}^{\\{n\\}}\\bigr)^T$ as $n \\to \\infty$. The proof exploits the Chinese restaurant sequential construction under $\u03b8=\u03bbn$ and a central limit theorem for triangular arrays of martingales, extending techniques previously developed for the classical regime with fixed $\u03b8$. As corollaries of our results, we recover known asymptotics for $K_n^{\\{n\\}}$ and derive new strong laws and central limit theorems for each fixed $K_{r,n}^{\\{n\\}}$, thereby completing earlier weak-law results and providing a comprehensive asymptotic description of the Ewens-Pitman partition structure in the large-$\u03b8$ setting.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale decentralized learning frameworks such as federated learning (FL), require both communication efficiency and strong data security, motivating the study of secure aggregation (SA). While information-theoretic SA is well understood in centralized and fully connected networks, its extension to decentralized networks with limited local connectivity remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces \\emph{topological secure aggregation} (TSA), which studies one-shot, information-theoretically secure aggregation of neighboring users' inputs over arbitrary network topologies. We develop a unified linear design framework that characterizes TSA achievability through the spectral properties of the communication graph, specifically the kernel of a diagonally modulated adjacency matrix. For several representative classes of $d$-regular graphs including ring, prism and complete topologies, we establish the optimal communication and secret key rate region. In particular, to securely compute one symbol of the neighborhood sum, each user must (i) store at least one key symbol, (ii) broadcast at least one message symbol, and (iii) collectively, all users must hold at least $d$ i.i.d. key symbols. Notably, this total key requirement depends only on the \\emph{neighborhood size} $d$, independent of the network size, revealing a fundamental limit of SA in decentralized networks with limited local connectivity.",

    "title": "How Entanglement Reshapes the Geometry of Quantum Differential Privacy",
    "abstract": "Quantum differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for quantifying privacy guarantees in quantum information processing. While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the classical solution to the master equation arising from mean-field games (MFGs) driven by jump-diffusion processes. The master equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation on Wasserstein space, characterizes the value function of MFGs and is challenging to analyze directly due to its measure-valued derivatives. We propose a probabilistic interpretation using coupled McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with jumps. Under suitable Lipschitz and differentiability assumptions on the coefficients, we first establish the well-posedness of the MV-FBSDEs on a small time interval via a contraction mapping argument. We then prove the existence and regularity of the first- and second-order derivatives of the solutions with respect to the spatial and measure variables, relying on careful estimates involving jump terms and measure derivatives. Finally, we show that the decoupling field of the MV-FBSDEs satisfies the master equation in the classical sense, providing both existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our work extends earlier results on diffusion-driven MFGs to the jump-diffusion setting and offers a probabilistic framework for analyzing and numerically solving such kind of master equations.",

    "abstract": "In convex geometry, the Shapley-Folkman Lemma asserts that the nonconvexity of a Minkowski sum of $n$ dimensional bounded nonconvex sets does not accumulate once the number of summands exceeds the dimension $n$, and thus the sum becomes approximately convex. Originally published by Starr in the context of quasi-equilibrium in nonconvex market models in economics, the lemma has since found widespread use in optimization, particularly for estimating the duality gap of the Lagrangian dual of separable nonconvex problems. Given its foundational nature, we pose the following geometric question: Is it possible for the nonconvexity of the Minkowski sum of $n$-dimensional nonconvex sets to even diminish instead of just not accumulating as the number of summands increases, under some general conditions? We answer this affirmatively. First, we provide an elementary geometric proof of the Shapley-Folkman Lemma based on the facial structure of the convex hull of each set. This leads to refinement of the classical error bound derived from the lemma. Building on this new geometric perspective, we further show that when most of the sets satisfy a certain local smoothness condition which naturally arises in the epigraphs of smooth functions, their Minkowski sum converges directly to a convex set, with a vanishing nonconvexity measure. In optimization, this implies that the Lagrangian dual of block-structured smooth nonconvex problems with potentially additional sparsity constraints is asymptotically tight under mild assumptions, which contracts nonvanishing duality gap obtained via classical Shapley-Folkman Lemma.",

    "abstract": "Across many scientific domains, practitioners rely on coarse, discretized summaries to track the evolving structure of complex systems under noise, measurement error, and changing system size. Understanding when such summaries are reliable -- and when apparent robustness is illusory -- remains a fundamental challenge. Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a case study: Crocker diagrams track the number of topological features across spatial scale and time, and because they are computationally efficient and easy to interpret, they have been widely used for exploratory analysis, bifurcation detection, model selection, and parameter inference. Despite their popularity, Crocker diagrams have lacked rigorous stability guarantees ensuring robustness to small data distortions. We develop a conditional stability theory for Crocker diagrams constructed from evolving point clouds. Our main results include deterministic conditions guaranteeing exact invariance when pairwise distances are well separated from the diagram's discretization thresholds, together with bounds on how much the diagrams can change when these conditions fail. We also establish probabilistic stability guarantees under Gaussian noise and bounds on topological change caused by adding or removing points, scaling linearly with the number of modified points. We illustrate these results using two complementary examples: an analytically tractable breathing polygon model that reveals how stability thresholds depend on geometry, and a feasibility analysis of epithelial cell imaging data showing when bounded-change guarantees provide the appropriate robustness framework. Together, these results reveal a two-tier stability structure for coarse, discretized topological summaries: exact invariance under verifiable geometric separation conditions, and geometry-controlled bounded change otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Consider the following story: A teacher announces to her students a test for the following week, such that the test will be ``surprising''. The students use this as the basis for a ``logical derivation'' and reach a contradiction, which they (falsely) interpret as saying that there cannot be a test. The teacher gives a test e.g. on Wednesday, ``surprising'' the students. Its curious turns give the story the flavor of a paradox. Alternative names are the {\\it unexpected hanging paradox\\/} and the {\\it prediction paradox}. Discussions and analyses of the story in the philosophical and mathematical literature are abundant, spanning 80 years until today. Apparently, none of the known explanations has been generally accepted as conclusive. We offer a fresh view, in propositional logic. ``Surprise'' is captured as unprovability of a certain formula from some axiom system. ``Knowledge'' corresponds to axiom systems and can be gained by mathematical proofs. The notorious property of self-reference in the announcement is cleanly accommodated. All errors made by the students are identified. A general analysis shows that the students cannot learn anything from the announcement. This is the first mathematically precise analysis of the story that shows that self-reference, full power of mathematical proofs, and truthfulness of the teacher can consistently coexist. The ``paradox'' vanishes. In order to facilitate comparisons with treatments using modal logic a version based on system S5 is also given. A formula $\u03c3$ is identified that formalizes ``there will be a surprising test'', and it is shown that the students take the announcement to mean $\\square\u03c3$ while in fact the information conveyed by it is not stronger than $\\diamond\u03c3$.

This shows in particular that centred random walk are diffusive on such groups. For polycyclic groups, this strengthens and completes partial results previously obtained by Russ Thompson in 2011.",

In this work, we establish sharper convergence guarantees for the Muon optimizer through a direct and simplified analysis that does not rely on restrictive assumptions on the update rule. Our results improve upon existing bounds by achieving faster convergence rates while covering a broader class of problem settings. These findings provide a more accurate theoretical characterization of Muon and offer insights applicable to a broader class of orthogonalized first-order methods.",

This framework serves as a model extension of the classical Noisy Integrate-and-Fire model, with a fixed firing potential. We first establish the well-posedness of the solution, establish the boundary condition at infinity which is the major difficulty. Then, state rigorously the entropy dissipation property.

In this paper, we show that on a flat Finsler Cartan--Hadamard manifold -- Berwald's metric space -- the classical picture alters radically: the Nash embedding theorem fails, the Sobolev space becomes nonlinear, and the Hardy and uncertainty inequalities break down completely, whereas the CKN inequality exhibits a sharp threshold in its validity depending on a parameter. By contrast, on Funk metric spaces -- another class of Finsler Cartan--Hadamard manifolds -- this threshold behavior disappears, although all the other non-Riemannian features persist. We trace this divergence to the lower bound of the $S$-curvature. As a consequence, the failure of the aforementioned functional inequalities is established for a broad class of Finsler manifolds.",

For weighted bipartite graphs, we show that a vertex is not sedentary whenever 0 does not belong to its eigenvalue support. Consequently, each vertex in a nonsingular weighted bipartite graph is not sedentary, a stark contrast to weighted trees and weighted planar graphs. A corollary of this result is that every vertex in a bipartite graph with a unique perfect matching is not sedentary for any assignment of edge weights. We also construct new families of weighted bipartite graphs with sedentary vertices using the bipartite double and subdivision operations.

Therefore, their aggregation requires a rigorous measurement-theoretic foundation to ensure mathematical validity, interpretability, and uniqueness. PFM establishes the principal axioms of unique preference aggregation, providing a rigorous basis on which aggregation can be demonstrated.\n  In this paper, it is shown that commonly used aggregation approaches in MCDM - such as weighted arithmetic and geometric means, as well as weighted distance-based optimisation methods - often fail to produce consistent rankings and are therefore unsuitable for pure MCDM. In contrast, the unique preference aggregation presented here clarifies the mathematical limits of valid aggregation and provides a principled, implementable foundation for robust multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and multi-objective design optimisation (MODO) in multi-faceted problems.",

In this article, we prove that the addition of a perturbation by a finite set of point-scatterers has a different effect: (i) all invariant measures are semiclassical measures for some sequence of eigenstates of the perturbed operator, and (ii) as soon as the set of scatterers contains a pair of antipodal points, it is possible to construct a sequence of eigenfunctions whose semiclassical measure is not invariant under the geodesic flow.

A discrete (describing the evolution of finitely many particles) solution is called sticky if, upon collision, particles stick together and move as one for all subsequent time, according to the conservation of mass and momentum principles. We prove results on the total energy (Hamiltonian) of the system and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of so-called \"perfect\" states, where the Hamiltonian is constant over all time and the solution converges to equilibrium, a single stationary particle. We provide a necessary and a sufficient condition for finite-time collapse, and present a quadratic envelope within which a solution must remain in order to collapse.

This rigidity allows classical Lie bialgebra constructions to extend systematically to the operator-equipped setting. Within this framework, we define ENL bialgebras and establish the associated notions of matched pairs, Manin triples, and Drinfel'd doubles. We show that coboundary ENL bialgebras are characterized by EN $r$-matrices satisfying an equivariant classical Yang-Baxter equation. We further introduce EN-relative Rota-Baxter operators and prove that they provide an operator-theoretic realization of such $r$-matrices, leading to descendent ENL algebras and to solutions of the classical Yang--Baxter equation on semidirect ENL algebras. In the quadratic case, this construction reduces to Rota-Baxter operators of weight zero. Finally, we extend the EN framework to pre-Lie algebras and show that pre-ENL algebras naturally induce associated ENL structures.",

When this link is missing, partially or completely, classical estimation methods fail in recovering the true regression function. Deconvolution approaches have been proposed and studied in detail in the unmatched setting where the predictive variables and responses are allowed to be independent. In this work, we consider linear regression in a semi-supervised learning setting where, beside a small sample of matched data, we have access to a relatively large unmatched sample. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we show that under some mild assumptions the semi-supervised learning empirical maximum likelihood estimator (SSLEMLE) is asymptotically normal and give explicitly its asymptotic covariance matrix as a function of the ratio of the matched/unmatched sample sizes and other parameters. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical gain achieved by having the additional large unmatched sample over having only the small matched sample. To illustrate the theory, we present the results of an extensive simulation study and apply our methodology to the \"combined cycle power plant\" data set.",

    "abstract": "The year 2025 marks the 100 and 30 years anniversaries of the discovery of Bose--Einstein condensation and its successful experimental realisation. Inspired by these important research achievements, a conceptually simple approach is proposed to facilitate reliable and efficient numerical simulations. The structure of the underlying systems of coupled Gross--Pitaevskii equations suggests the use of optimised high-order operator splitting methods for dynamical evolution and ground state computation. A second-order barrier, however, prevents the applicability of standard operator splitting methods for both, time evolution as well as imaginary time propagation. An innovative alternative approach accomplishes the design of novel modified operator splitting methods that remain stable under moderate smallness assumptions on the time increments. The core idea is to incorporate commutators of the defining differential and nonlinear multiplication operators, since this permits to fulfill the basic stability requirement of positive method coefficients. Further improvements with respect to convergence at the targeted precision arise from automatic adjustments of the time stepsizes by an inexpensive local error control. The presented numerical experiments confirm the favourable performance of a specific fourth-order modified operator splitting method. Amongst others, it is demonstrated that the excellent mass and energy conservation in long-term evolutions, intrinsic attributes of geometric numerical integrators for Hamiltonian systems, is maintained for a sensible variation of the time stepsizes. Moreover, the benefits of adaptive higher-order approximations in ground state computations are illustrated.",

    "abstract": "This thesis studies qualitative properties of solutions to nonlinear elliptic equations of Poisson type with Dirichlet boundary conditions that arise from some physical phenomena, with a particular focus on regularity, stability, and multiplicity of solutions. Building on the modern framework of solution stability and Morse index theory, the work investigates how these notions influence regularity in nonlinear elliptic problems. A central contribution is the construction of a counterexample showing that bounded radial Morse index does not prevent singular behavior of solutions in dimensions three through nine, challenging a natural extension of the Brezis-V\u00e1zquez regularity conjecture. In addition, optimal regularity results are established for radial solutions of a non-autonomous Hardy-H\u00e9non equation, identifying the precise range of dimensions for which regularity holds. The thesis also addresses existence and multiplicity results for elliptic equations involving nonlinearities with spatially vanishing coefficients. Under suitable assumptions, the existence of multiple distinct solutions is proved using variational and topological methods. Finally, the thesis outlines several directions for future research, including extensions of stability-based regularity techniques to non-autonomous problems and potential applications of these techniques to field theories arising in theoretical physics.",

Our main result proves that as soon as the Laplacian is perturbed by a finite family of Dirac masses placed at points whose set of looping directions has zero measure, semiclassical measures corresponding to high-frequency sequences of eigenfunctions are supported on the unit cosphere bundle and invariant under the geodesic flow.

    "title": "Joint Power Allocation and Antenna Placement for Pinching-Antenna Systems under User Location Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "Pinching antenna systems have attracted much attention recently owing to its capability to maintain reliable line-of-sight (LoS) communication in high-frequency bands. By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme greatly enhances both EE and system reliability compared with fixed-antenna benchmark, validating its effectiveness for practical high-frequency wireless deployments.",

This random variable captures the effect of early demographic fluctuations and determines the random amplitude of long-term exponential population growth. While the existence of a non-trivial limit is ensured by the Kesten-Stigum theorem, computing its density in a stable and efficient manner for arbitrary offspring laws remains a significant challenge. The proposed approach leverages a functional equation that characterizes the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the limit distribution and combines it with a moment-matching method to obtain accurate approximations within a class of linear combinations of Laguerre polynomials with exponential damping. The effectiveness of the approach is validated on several examples in which the offspring generating function is a polynomial of bounded degree.",

    "abstract": "In 1993, Robert Strichartz established a characterization for bounded eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Let $\\left\\{f_k \\right\\}_{k\\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ be a doubly infinite sequence of functions on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying $\u0394f_k= f_{k+1}$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. If $\\left\\{f_k \\right\\}$'s are uniformly bounded, then Strichartz proved that $\u0394f_0= f_0$, thus generalizing a classical result of Roe on the real line. Recognizing that many physically significant eigenfunctions exhibit unbounded behavior, Howard and Reese extended this result to include functions of polynomial growth. Building upon a refined functional-analytic framework, we recently established a broader extension of Strichartz's theorem encompassing eigenfunctions of exponential growth. In the present article, we further investigate the spectral geometry of the Laplacian by replacing the differential operator with a broader class of Fourier multipliers. Specifically, we focus on radial convolution operators, including the spherical average, the ball average, and the heat operator. The central problem addressed is as follows: For a fixed multiplier $\u0398$, we consider a doubly infinite sequence of exponentially growing functions $\\{f_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ satisfying the recurrence relation $\u0398f_k = A f_{k+1}$ for a complex constant $A$. We demonstrate that under specific spectral conditions, the functions $f_k$ correspond precisely to the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian $\u0394$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. This result provides a unified approach to characterization theorems, linking the growth rate of eigenfunctions to the symbol of the associated multiplier.",

The formulation derives boundary integral equations from the Stratton-Chu representation for the azimuthal component of the vector potential in both air and conductive regions. The central contribution is a unified regularization framework for the two-dimensional (2D) singular integrals arising in Galerkin BEM. This framework handles both logarithmic and Cauchy singularities through a common set of integral transformations, eliminating the need for case-by-case analytical singularity extraction and enabling straightforward numerical quadrature. The regularization and quadrature stability are proved and verified numerically. The method is validated on several representative axisymmetric geometries, including cylindrical, conical, and spherical shells. Numerical experiments demonstrate consistently high accuracy and computational efficiency across broad frequency ranges and coil lift-off distances. The results confirm that the proposed axisymmetric Galerkin BEM, combined with the integral transformation technique, provides a robust and efficient framework for axisymmetric eddy-current nondestructive evaluation.",

We introduce the U-bit collapse metric delta = log_2(n) - log_2(U_d mod n) to quantify deviation from the expected uniform distribution of Lucas sequence terms. Analysis reveals minimal collapse values: mean delta = 1.61 bits, median delta = 1.0 bits, maximum delta = 8 bits, with 26% showing no measurable collapse. We analyze correlations with prime residue classes modulo 35, Arnault construction parameters (k,M), and composite bit-sizes. Our results demonstrate that composites engineered for Miller-Rabin resistance exhibit negligible Lucas sequence degeneracy, providing strong empirical evidence for the statistical independence of these two primality test components and supporting the continued robustness of Baillie-PSW-type tests.",

In this work, we consider the adaptive construction of interpolating rational approximations while aiming for the smallest feasible degree to satisfy a given error tolerance. To this end, we introduce refinement approaches to the linear least-squares step of the classical AAA algorithm that aim to minimize the true nonlinear least-squares error with respect to the given data. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the derived approaches in terms of the corresponding gradients from the resulting minimization problems and use these insights to propose a new greedy framework that ensures monotonic error convergence. Numerical examples from function approximation and model order reduction verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to construct accurate rational approximations of small degrees.",

The set of all tensors representable by a given network forms the corresponding tensor network variety. A very basic question asks whether every tensor representable by one network is representable by another network, namely, when one tensor network variety is contained in another. Specific instances of this question became known as the Hackbusch Conjecture. Here, we propose a general framework for this question and take first steps, theoretical as well as experimental, towards a better understanding. In particular, given any two binary trees on $n$ leaves, we define (and prove existence of) a new measure, the containment exponent, which gauges how much one has to boost the parameters of one network for the containment to hold. We present an algorithm for bounding these containment exponents of tensor network varieties and report on an exhaustive search among trees on up to $n=8$ leaves.",

    "abstract": "The management of irrigation water systems has become increasingly complex due to competing demands for agricultural production, groundwater sustainability, and environmental flow requirements, particularly under hydrologic variability and climate uncertainty. Addressing these challenges requires optimization frameworks that can jointly determine optimal crop allocation, groundwater pumping, and environmental flow releases while maintaining economic and hydrological feasibility. However, existing hydro-economic models, including the widely used Lewis and Randall formulation, may overestimate net benefits by allowing infeasible negative pumping and surface water allocations. We extend the Lewis and Randall framework by reformulating groundwater pumping and surface water use as non-negative, demand-driven decision variables and by explicitly incorporating environmental flow and canal capacity constraints. Three models are developed to maximize economic benefit, minimize environmental deficits, and a multiobjective model that evaluates the trade-offs between these two objectives. An illustrative test case examining optimal crop area allocation and environmental flow management across dry, average, and wet years, using data from the Rajshahi Barind Tract in northwestern Bangladesh, is presented. The results show that the proposed formulation produces economically and hydrologically consistent solutions, identifying optimal strategies when either net benefits or environmental protection is prioritized, as well as Pareto-optimal trade-offs when both objectives are considered together. These findings provide practical insights for balancing farm income, groundwater sustainability, and ecological protection, offering a robust decision-support tool for irrigation management in water-limited river basins.",

Risk sensitivity is modeled through the fractional parameter, interpolating between conservative or risk aversion and adventurous or high risk tolerance attitudes. Furthermore, the robustness and statistical significance of the fractional order entropy-based risk measure, termed normalized expected utility-fractional entropy (NEU-FE) and normalized expected utility-fractional entropy-variance (NEU-FEV) risk measures are explained with the help of machine learning tools, including Random forest, Ridge regression, Lasso Regression and artificial neural networks by using Indian stock market (NIFTY50).

In particular, for such operators, supercyclicity, Li-Yorke chaos, hypercyclicity, weak mixing, and Devaney chaos are all equivalent.\n  In contrast to this collapse, we show that the classical equivalence between Devaney chaos and the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion for weighted backward shifts fails for odometers. Specifically, we construct a mixing, chaotic, and distributionally chaotic composition operator that does not satisfy the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion.

Recently, for the Dirichlet BVP with data $g$, Caetano et al (2025) have proposed an integral equation (IE) $A_k\u03c6=g$ that applies for arbitrary compact $\u0393$. This formulation is a generalisation of standard first kind IEs, where the BIO is $S_k$, the single-layer BIO on a surface $\u0393$, that apply when $\u0393$ is the boundary of a Lipschitz domain or a screen.\n  In this paper we study the dependence of $A_k$ on $k$, showing that, for $k\\geq k_0>0$, $\\|A_k\\|\\leq ck$ while $\\|A_k^{-1}\\| \\leq c'k$ if $\u0393$ is star-shaped, where $c, c'>0$ depend only on $k_0$ and $\u0393$. Amongst other bounds we also show that: (i) on the one hand, given any mildly increasing unbounded positive sequence $(k_m)$ and any unbounded sequence $(a_m)$, there exists $\u0393$, with connected complement, such that $\\|A_{k_m}^{-1}\\|\\geq a_m$ for every $m$; (ii) on the other hand, for every $\u0393\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $k_0,\\varepsilon, \u03b4>0$, there exists $c>0$ and $E\\subset [k_0,\\infty)$, with Lebesgue measure $m(E)\\leq \\varepsilon$, such that $\\|A_{k}^{-1}\\|\\leq c k^{2n+2+\u03b4}$ on $[k_0,\\infty)\\setminus E$, i.e., the growth of $\\|A_{k}^{-1}\\|$ is at worst polynomial in $k$ if one avoids a set $E$ of arbitrarily small measure.\n  As a corollary of these results we obtain the first $k$-explicit bounds on $\\|S_k^{-1}\\|$ and the condition number of $S_k$ for the case that $\u0393$ is the boundary of a Lipschitz domain, or a screen not contained in a hyperplane, and analogous estimates for the case that $\u0393$ is a $d$-set (and so of Hausdorff dimension $d$), for non-integer values of $d$.",

The conventional definition of sub- and super-solutions based on variational inequalities often fails for natural function classes such as piecewise linear functions and encounters theoretical difficulties in non-convex polygonal domains, where H^2 regularity is lost because of corner singularities. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the concept of ``Green-representable solutions'' utilizing test functions constructed from fundamental solutions. This framework enables a new formulation of sub- and super-solutions that permits rigorous pointwise evaluation. For one-dimensional problems, we derive explicit constructions of the test functions. For two-dimensional polygonal domains, we employ the Method of Fundamental Solutions to generate test functions. The approach is validated through numerical experiments in both settings, including non-convex polygons. The results demonstrate that the proposed method yields strict and accurate pointwise enclosures of the true solution, even for problems with discontinuous source terms or geometric singularities.",

    "abstract": "Generally, multi-objective optimisation problems are solved exactly or approximated by solving a series of scalarisations, for example by dichotomic search. In this paper, we take a different approach and attempt to compute the set of all extreme-supported non-dominated points of a bi-objective combinatorial optimisation problem by using a neighbourhood-based approach. Whether or not this works depends on the definition of adjacency and we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee its success. The resulting generic algorithm is an alternative to dichotomic search in our setting.\n  We then apply our generic algorithm to a specific example: the bi-objective minimum weight basis problem, in which we are given a matroid and want to find bases of minimum weight. We use the natural definition of adjacency, in which two bases are adjacent if they differ in exactly one element. Since this satisfies our sufficient condition on the adjacency relation, our generic algorithm works in this case and we analyse its running time, showing that it is polynomial. By tailoring this algorithm specifically to matroids, we obtain one that is faster but no longer transitions between adjacent solutions, instead swapping directly from one extreme-supported point to the next in a combinatorial fashion.",

We consider a single-server setting with stochastic service and travel times, where customers are promised a time window in which the provider will arrive. The first part of the paper introduces a static window construction method based on a probabilistic threshold criterion, using an analytical approximation of residual travel and service time distributions. Building on this, we develop a dynamic update mechanism that monitors residual system uncertainty, where time windows are revised during execution only when the remaining time until the window's start falls below a predefined threshold. This threshold-based approach enables communication-efficient scheduling while substantially improving delivery accuracy. Numerical experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the dynamic approach in both stylized and real-world settings.",

This result demonstrates that the incompressible system acts as a universal attractor in this setting: every incompressible flow can be realized as the limit of convex integration solutions to the compressible system.

Training-free diffusion models provide an attractive alternative by exploiting analytically tractable score functions, and have recently enabled supervised learning of efficient end-to-end generative samplers. Despite their empirical success, the training-free diffusion models lack rigorous and numerically verifiable error estimates. In this work, we develop a comprehensive error analysis for a class of training-free diffusion models used to generate labeled data for supervised learning of generative samplers. By exploiting the availability of the exact score function for Gaussian mixture models, our analysis avoids propagating score-function approximation errors through the reverse-time diffusion process and recovers classical convergence rates for ODE discretization schemes, such as first-order convergence for the Euler method. Moreover, the resulting error bounds exhibit favorable dimension dependence, scaling as $O(d)$ in the $\\ell_2$ norm and $O(\\log d)$ in the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm.

These results are inspired by the study of Lane-Emden system of equations as in \\cite{busca2002liouville,ghergu2010lane}.",

    "title": "On semigroups which admit only discrete left-continuous Hausdorff topology",
    "abstract": "We give the sufficient condition when every left-continuous (right-continuous) Hausdorff topology on a semigroup $S$ is discrete. We construct a submonoid $\\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ (resp., $\\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$) of the bicyclic monoid which contains a family $\\{S_\u03b1\\colon \u03b1\\in\\mathfrak{c}\\}$ of continuum many subsemigroups with the following properties: $(i)$ every left-continuous (resp., right-continuous) Hausdorff topology on $S_\u03b1$ is discrete; $(ii)$ every semigroup $S_\u03b1$ admits a non-discrete right-continuous (resp., left-continuous) Hausdorff topology which is not left-continuous (resp., right-continuous); $(iii)$ every semigroup $S_\u03b1$ isomorphically embeds into a Hausdorff compact topological semigroup. Also we construct a submonoid $\\mathscr{C}_{\\mathbb{Z}}^+$ (resp., $\\mathscr{C}_{\\mathbb{Z}}^-$) of the extended bicyclic semigroup which contains a family $\\{S_\u03b1\\colon \u03b1\\in\\mathfrak{c}\\}$ of continuum many subsemigroups with the above described properties.",

    "title": "An Energy-Preserving Domain of Dependence Stabilization for the Linear Wave Equation on Cut-Cell Meshes",
    "abstract": "We present an energy-preserving (either energy-conservative or energy-dissipative) domain of dependence stabilization method for the linear wave equation on cut-cell meshes. Our scheme is based on a standard discontinuous Galerkin discretization in space and an explicit (strong stability preserving) Runge Kutta method in time. Tailored stabilization terms allow for selecting the time step length based on the size of the background cells rather than the small cut cells by propagating information across small cut cells. The stabilization terms preserve the energy stability or energy conservation property of the underlying discontinuous Galerkin space discretization. Numerical results display the high accuracy and stability properties of our scheme.",
