    "title": "Biquadratic Cauchy Tensors and Spherical Biquadratic Polynomial Programming",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses biquadratic polynomial programming (BPP), an NP-hard optimization problem closely related to biquadratic tensors. We first establish several necessary and sufficient conditions for the positive semi-definiteness and positive definiteness of biquadratic Cauchy tensors. Leveraging the structured properties of these tensors, we then prove that the BPP and its equivalent multilinear formulation share the same set of optimal solutions. This result allows us to establish the global sequence convergence of the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm via the Kurdyka- Lojasiewicz (KL) property, extending the analysis in [8]. Furthermore, by reformulating the equivalent multilinear problem as an unconstrained optimization model, we enable the analysis of its KL exponent and derive an explicit expression for the convergence rate of PAM. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both biquadratic Cauchy tensors and general biquadratic tensor instances to evaluate the efficiency, stability, and practical performance of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We study a noisy linear observation model with an unknown permutation called permuted/shuffled linear regression, where responses and covariates are mismatched and the permutation forms a discrete, factorial-size parameter. This unknown permutation is a key component of the data-generating process, yet its statistical investigation remains challenging due to its discrete nature. In this study, we develop a general statistical inference framework on the permutation and regression coefficients. First, we introduce a localization step that reduces the permutation space to a small candidate set building on recent advances in the repro samples method, whose miscoverage decays polynomially with the number of Monte Carlo samples. Then, based on this localized set, we provide statistical inference procedures: a conditional Monte Carlo test of permutation structures with valid finite-sample Type-I error control. We also develop coefficient inference that remains valid under alignment uncertainty of permutations. For computational purposes, we develop a linear assignment problem computable in polynomial time complexity and demonstrate that its solution asymptotically converges to that of the conventional least squares problem with large computational cost. Extensions to partially permuted designs and ridge regularization are also discussed. Extensive simulations and an application to Beijing air-quality data corroborate finite-sample validity, strong power to detect mismatches, and practical scalability.",

    "abstract": "Inverse problems in computational physics often require matching high-dimensional spatio-temporal fields, leading to prohibitive computational costs and ill-conditioned optimizations. We introduce modal-centric field inversion (MCFI), a paradigm that reformulates inverse problems in the reduced space of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes rather than the full physical state space. By targeting dominant flow structures instead of point-wise field values, MCFI provides a compact, physically meaningful objective that naturally regularizes the inversion and dramatically reduces computational burden. Central to this framework is the differentiable POD: an adjoint-based method that efficiently computes sensitivities of POD modes with respect to model parameters, enabling gradient-based optimization in the modal space. We demonstrate MCFI on a one and two-dimensional modified viscous Burger's equation, optimizing spatially varying coefficients to match target dynamics through mode-matching. The adjoint formulation achieves computational cost independent of parameter dimension, in contrast to finite-difference approaches that scale linearly. MCFI establishes a foundation for scalable inverse design and model calibration in unsteady, high-dimensional systems.",

We explain why only squarefree divisors are involved, show how multiplicativity naturally comes into play, and interpret the identity as a finite Euler product. Beyond this one-parameter family of generalizations, we describe a general method for constructing similar formulas and present several examples. Finally, we reformulate these identities in terms of partial zeta functions, thus emphasizing their close relationship with the classical theory of Euler products and the Riemann zeta function.

    "title": "New Perspectives On The Unimodality Of Domination Polynomials",
    "abstract": "The domination polynomial of a graph $G$ is given by $D(G,x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} d_k(G)x^k$ where $d_k(G)$ records the number of $k$-element dominating sets in $G$. A conjecture of Alikhani and Peng asserts that these polynomials have unimodal coefficient sequences. We develop three complementary perspectives that strengthen existing tools for resolving the conjecture. First, we view dominating sets as transversals of the closed neighborhood hypergraph. Motivated by the relationship between the unimodality of a polynomial and its roots, we use this perspective to expand on known root phenomena for domination polynomials. In particular, we obtain a bound on the modulus of domination roots that is linear in the maximum degree of a graph, improving related exponential bounds of Bencs, Csikv\u00e1ri and Regts. The hypergraph viewpoint also yields explicit combinatorial formulas for top coefficients of $D(G,x)$, extending formulas in the literature and offering fruitful ground for combinatorial approaches to the unimodality conjecture. Second, we strengthen the coefficient-ratio method of Beaton and Brown. This includes tightening their inequalities, and combining a union bound for non-dominating $k$-element sets with an overlap correction based on spanning trees. This produces a new parameter $\u03c4_k(G)$ measuring maximal pairwise neighborhood overlap and yields an overlap-corrected sufficient criterion for unimodality. Third, we prove that the domination polynomial of threshold graphs are log-concave, and hence unimodal, by a planar network argument from total positivity. This offers a new tactic for resolving the unimodality of hereditary graph classes.",

Like all particle methods, the FP method is inherently stochastic, which leads to statistical fluctuations in macroscopic quantities and necessitates large particle numbers for accurate results. In this work, we investigate the use of quasi-random numbers, which sample distributions more evenly and thereby reduce the variance. To preserve the low-discrepancy structure across time steps, we employ the Array Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo (Array-RQMC) technique. We combine the FP method with Array-RQMC and compare it in homogeneous and inhomogeneous problems with other commonly used variance-reduction techniques. The proposed FP-Array-RQMC approach achieves improved convergence rates compared with pseudo-random sampling and yields smaller estimator errors for sufficiently large particle numbers.",

    "abstract": "This work presents two integration methods for field transfer in computational aeroacoustics and in coupled field problems, using the finite element method to solve the acoustic field. Firstly, a high-order Gaussian quadrature computes the finite element right-hand side. In contrast, the (flow) field provided by the finite difference mesh is mapped by higher-order B-Splines or a Lagrangian function. Secondly, the cut-cell or supermesh integration with geometric clipping. For each method, the accuracy, performance characteristics, and computational complexity are analyzed. As a reference, the trapezoidal integration rule was computed from the finite difference results. The high-order quadrature converges as the B-Spline interpolation order increases, and the finite difference results and mesh resolutions are consistent. The supermesh approach eliminates interpolation and approximation errors at the grid-to-mesh level and improves accuracy. This behaviour is universal for smooth or strongly oscillating field quantities, which will be shown in a comparative study between the Lighthill-like source term and the source term of the perturbed convective wave equation for subsonic flows.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the potential of movable antennas (MAs) to enhance physical layer security within a multiple-input multiple-output multiple-antenna eavesdropper (MIMOME) system. We consider a practical scenario where the transmitter operates with imperfect eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI), knowing only the instantaneous line-of-sight (LoS) component and the statistical properties of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) component. To rigorously quantify secrecy performance under the ECSI uncertainty, we adopt the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) as the metric. Since deriving an exact analytical expression for the ESR is intractable, we leverage random matrix theory to derive a deterministic equivalent. This avoids heavy Monte Carlo simulations and also provides explicit insights into the effects of channel spatial statistics on secrecy performance. Building upon the deterministic equivalent, we formulate a joint maximization problem for the transmit precoding matrix and the antenna positions at the legitimate transmitter. To tackle the non-convexity of this optimization problem, we develop a comprehensive alternating optimization framework. Specifically, the precoding matrix is optimized via a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm, where the gradient is computed by solving an implicit fixed-point equation. For the antenna position optimization, the complexity of the objective function prevents the construction of standard MM surrogate. To this end, we further propose a novel AMSGrad-based surrogate function that relies solely on gradient information. We provide a rigorous theoretical proof that guarantees the convergence of this proposed algorithm despite relaxing the strict majorization conditions.",

A $(t,s)$-BRC guarantees correct decoding of the original message even after up to~$t$ arbitrary breaks of the codeword and the complete loss of some fragments whose total length is at most~$s$. This model unifies and generalizes previous approaches, extending break-resilient codes (which handle arbitrary fragmentation without fragment loss) and deletion codes (which correct bit losses in unknown positions without fragmentation) into a single information-theoretic framework.

For unimodular random IAG, we establish an ICP analog of the dichotomy theorem of Angel-Hutchcroft-Nachmias-Ray [4,5]. Specifically, the character $T(\u03c1):=\\sum_{e\\ni\u03c1}\u0398_e$ of an IAG, introduced in [40], determines its ICP type: the graph is a.s. ICP-parabolic if and only if $\\mathbb{E}[T(\u03c1)]=2\u03c0$. In the ICP-hyperbolic case, the simple random walk converges a.s. to $\\partial\\mathbb{D}$ with positive hyperbolic speed. Moreover, the geometric, Poisson, Martin, and Gromov boundaries coincide, extending the boundary theory of Angel-Barlow-Gurevich-Nachmias [3] and Hutchcroft-Peres [37] beyond triangulations to cellular decompositions. As a corollary of the aforementioned IHP/IAG duality, we obtain the systematic characterizations of the random IHP. To develop our theory, we strengthen and refine the Ring Lemma of Ge-Yu-Zhou [27] for ICP, which provides quantitative local control of the packing geometry.

    "abstract": "We study a time--space nonlocal diffusion equation driven by additive time--space white noise, where the time derivative is the Caputo derivative of order $\u03b1\\in(0,2)$. The model couples local diffusion with a nonlocal convolution operator generated by a radial probability density, thus incorporating memory effects and long-range spatial interactions.\n  For Dirac initial data, we derive an explicit solution formula in the space of tempered distributions, decomposing the solution into a deterministic part and a stochastic convolution kernel expressed through Mittag--Leffler functions. Our main contribution is a sharp characterization of the existence of mild solutions in terms of $\u03b1$, the spatial dimension $N$, and the coefficients of the local and nonlocal diffusion terms. In particular, when the Laplacian term is absent, no mild solution exists, whereas for $\u03bb>0$ the admissible regimes depend critically on $(\u03b1,N)$, extending and sharpening the known results for purely local fractional stochastic heat equations. Numerical simulations illustrate the evolution of the mean and variance and emphasize subdiffusive spreading and memory effects.",

    "title": "A fast-pivoting algorithm for Whittle's restless bandit index",
    "abstract": "The Whittle index for restless bandits (two-action semi-Markov decision processes) provides an intuitively appealing optimal policy for controlling a single generic project that can be active (engaged) or passive (rested) at each decision epoch, and which can change state while passive. It further provides a practical heuristic priority-index policy for the computationally intractable multi-armed restless bandit problem, which has been widely applied over the last three decades in multifarious settings, yet mostly restricted to project models with a one-dimensional state. This is due in part to the difficulty of establishing indexability (existence of the index) and of computing the index for projects with large state spaces. This paper draws on the author's prior results on sufficient indexability conditions and an adaptive-greedy algorithmic scheme for restless bandits to obtain a new fast-pivoting algorithm that computes the $n$ Whittle index values of an $n$-state restless bandit by performing, after an initialization stage, $n$ steps that entail $(2/3) n^3 + O(n^2)$ arithmetic operations. This algorithm also draws on the parametric simplex method, and is based on elucidating the pattern of parametric simplex tableaux, which allows to exploit special structure to substantially simplify and reduce the complexity of simplex pivoting steps. A numerical study demonstrates substantial runtime speed-ups versus alternative algorithms.",

As the Taylor number increases further, these vortices themselves become unstable, transitioning into wavy Taylor vortices.\n  In this article, we focus on the small-gap limit, where the ratio of the cylinder radii approaches unity and the rotation rates of the cylinders are nearly identical. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence of a critical Taylor number $T_c$, at which the Couette flow loses stability.\n  For Taylor numbers just above $T_c$, under fixed axial periodicity, the solutions to the limiting Navier-Stokes system are governed by a Ginzburg-Landau-type partial differential equation. Beyond the classical Taylor vortex flow, we demonstrate that a two-parameter family of solutions emerges at criticality for $T>T_c$. This family includes not only wavy vortices but also a variety of other exotic flow patterns, all of which remain steady in the frame rotating at the average angular velocity of the cylinders.",

This framework has applications to questions in quasiconformal geometry. In particular, quasi-visual approximations can be used to detect whether a given homeomorphism between two bounded metric spaces is a quasisymmetry.\n  We also explore the connection to the theory of Gromov hyperbolic spaces via the tile graph associated with a quasi-visual approximation. As an application, we relate these ideas to the dynamics of semi-hyperbolic rational maps. More specifically, we show that the Julia set of a rational map admits a dynamical quasi-visual approximation if and only if the map is semi-hyperbolic.",

We obtain new results on critical sets of Chebyshev centers, and for that purpose, surprisingly, notions from the combinatorial geometry of convex bodies play an essential role.

In particular, we prove global area contraction for disks, star-shaped sets, and sufficiently small sets, and we refine the results using Hardy space methods to obtain sharp bounds with equality only for conformal automorphisms.

The offspring distribution at generation $n$ depends on the environment $\u03be_n$, and we denote by $M_n = (M_n(i,j))_{1 \\le i,j \\le d}$ the corresponding (random) mean matrix. Recently, Grama et al. (Ann. Appl. Probab. \\textbf{33}(2023) 1213-1251) extended the famous Kesten--Stigum theorem to the random environment case with $d>1$. They improved upon previous work by innovatively constructing a new normalized population process $(\\tilde{W}^i_n)$. Under several simple assumptions, they proved that $\\tilde{W}^i_n$ converges almost surely to a limit $\\tilde{W}^i$, and that $\\tilde{W}^i$ is non-degenerate if and only if a $\\mbb{E}X\\log^+ X<\\infty$ type condition holds.\n  In this paper, we study the situation where an immigrant vector $Y_n$ joins the population $Z_n^i$ at each generation $n \\ge 0$; the distribution of $Y_n$ also depends on the environment $\u03be_n$. Following the approach of Grama et al., we construct a normalized process $(W^i_n)$ for the model with immigration, establishing a Kesten--Stigum type theorem that characterizes the non-degeneracy of its almost sure limit. Moreover, we provide complete $L^p$-convergence criteria for $(W^i_n)$, treating separately the cases $1 < p < \\infty$ and $0 < p < 1$. As an important byproduct, a sufficient condition for the boundedness of the maximal function $\\sup_n \\tilde{W}_n^i$ is also obtained. Our results show that, under a mild restriction on the number of immigrants, the inclusion of immigration does not affect the almost sure convergence property of the original normalized process, but it does have an impact on the criterion for $L^p$ convergence.",

This fundamental problem arises in designing denoisers used in message-passing algorithms for sublinear sparsity. The main results are direct and converse theorems in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity grows sublinearly in the signal dimension as the signal dimension tends to infinity. As a direct theorem, the maximum likelihood estimator is proved to achieve vanishing square error in the sublinear sparsity limit if the noise variance is smaller than a threshold. As a converse theorem, all estimators cannot achieve square errors smaller than the signal power under a mild condition if the noise variance is larger than another threshold. In particular, the two thresholds coincide with each other when non-zero signals have constant amplitude. These results imply the asymptotic optimality of an existing separable Bayesian estimator used in approximate message-passing for sublinear sparsity.",

Assuming a local decrease condition for the underlying operator and standard requirements on the stepsizes $(\u03b1_k) \\subset (0,1)$, we first prove strong convergence of the Halpern sequence $x_{k+1} = \u03b1_k x_0 + (1-\u03b1_k) T x_k$ to the best approximation point $x^\\star$ in the intersection set, that is, the metric projection of $x_0$ onto that set. Under the additional assumption that the intersection satisfies a H\u00f6lder-type error bound with exponent $\u03b3\\in (0,1]$, we then derive explicit convergence rates for both feasibility and norm error: the distance from $x_k$ to the intersection set decays like $\\mathcal O(\u03b1_k^{\u03b3/(2-\u03b3)})$, while the norm error $\\|x_k - x^\\star\\|$ decays like $\\mathcal O(\u03b1_k^{\u03b3/(4-2\u03b3)})$.

Our numerical experiments show that Halpern-type iterations combined with most of these projection-type operators are quicker than Dykstra's algorithm to find the projection of a point in an intersection of ellipsoids or in an intersection of polyhedrons.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the value distribution and growth properties of linear total differential polynomials $\\mathcal{L}_k[D]f$ for meromorphic functions in several complex variables $\\mathbb{C}^n$. By extending the classical Milloux inequality to the framework of total derivatives, we derive a series of fundamental growth estimates for the Nevanlinna characteristic function $T(r, \\mathcal{L}_k[D]f)$. We address the value-sharing problem for meromorphic functions $f$ and $g$ sharing values with their differential polynomials. Under the condition $2\u03b4(0,f)+(k+4)\u0398(\\infty,f)>k+5$, we establish that $\\frac{\\mathcal{L}_k[D]f-1}{\\mathcal{L}_k[D]g-1}$ is a non-zero constant for non-transcendental meromorphic functions. Furthermore, we provide an affirmative answer to several Picard-type inquiries, proving that if an entire function $f$ in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ omits a value $a$ while its linear total differential polynomial $\\mathcal{L}_k[D]f$ omits a non-zero value $b$, then $f$ must be constant. Our results generalize and extend several existing uniqueness and Picard-type theorems from the classical one-variable setting to the higher-dimensional complex space $\\mathbb{C}^n$.",

This paper investigates the probability distribution of these cluster sizes. For stationary random fields, we derive exact expressions for the cluster size distribution. To address nonstationary settings, we introduce a peak-based cluster size distribution, which characterizes the distribution of cluster sizes conditional on the presence of a local maximum above $u$. This formulation provides a tractable alternative when exact cluster size distributions are analytically inaccessible. The proposed framework applies broadly to Gaussian and non-Gaussian random fields, relying only on their joint dependence structure. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for quantifying spatial extent in discretely sampled data, with applications to medical imaging, geoscience, environmental monitoring, and other scientific areas where thresholded random fields naturally arise.",

    "abstract": "We propose a rank-one Riemannian subspace descent algorithm for computing symmetric positive definite (SPD) solutions to nonlinear matrix equations arising in control theory, dynamic programming, and stochastic filtering. For solution matrices of size $n\\times n$, standard approaches for dense matrix equations typically incur $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ cost per-iteration, while the efficient $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ methods either rely on sparsity or low-rank solutions, or have iteration counts that scale poorly. The proposed method entails updating along the dominant eigen-component of a transformed Riemannian gradient, identified using at most $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))$ power iterations. The update structure also enables exact step-size selection in many cases at minimal additional cost. For objectives defined as compositions of standard matrix operations, each iteration can be implemented using only matrix--vector products, yielding $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ arithmetic cost. We prove an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ iteration bound under standard smoothness assumptions, with improved bounds under geodesic strong convexity. Numerical experiments on large-scale CARE, DARE, and other nonlinear matrix equations show that the proposed algorithm solves instances (up to $n=10{,}000$ in our tests) for which the compared solvers, including MATLAB's \\texttt{icare}, structure-preserving doubling, and subspace-descent baselines fail to return a solution. These results demonstrate that rank-one manifold updates provide a practical approach for high-dimensional and dense SPD-constrained matrix equations.

Moreover, a linear and symmetric variant of the geometric multigrid preconditioner that is suitable for the (standard) preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG) is provided and analyzed. We show that both preconditioners are optimal in the sense that, first, the resulting algebraic solvers admit a contraction factor that is independent of the local mesh size h and the polynomial degree p, and, second, that they can be applied with linear computational complexity. Related to this, quasi-optimal computational cost of the overall adaptive finite element method is addressed. Numerical experiments underline the theoretical findings.",

Next, based on this function and a sigma-modification strategy in which the leakage term starts to vanish at t > T, we develop an adaptive dynamic surface control framework to reduce control complexity, deal with uncertainties, ensure prescribed performance, practical prescribed-time convergence to a specific region, and ultimately achieve asymptotic convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "We study the maximum size of a subset of the $n \\times n$ integer grid that does not contain specific geometric configurations, a variation of the classical problems initiated by Erd\u0151s and Purdy. While extremal problems for 3-point patterns, such as collinear triples and right triangles are well-studied, the landscape for 4-point configurations in the grid remains less explored. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art regarding forbidden 3-point and 4-point configurations, including parallelograms, trapezoids, and concyclic sets. Furthermore, we prove new lower bounds for grid subsets avoiding rhombuses and kites. Specifically, by combining the probabilistic method with the arithmetic properties of Sidon sets, we show that the maximum size of a rhombus-free subset is $\u03a9(n^{4/3}(\\log n)^{-1/3})$. We also provide near-quadratic lower bounds for sets avoiding kites with axis-parallel diagonals using Behrend-type constructions and discuss implications for square-free sets. These results illustrate the strong interplay between discrete geometry and additive combinatorics.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a static event-triggered control strategy for multivariable Newton-based extremum seeking. The proposed method integrates event-triggered actuation into the Newton-based optimization framework to reduce control updates while maintaining rapid convergence to the extremum. Unlike traditional gradient-based extremum seeking, where the convergence rate depends on the unknown Hessian of the cost function, the proposed approach employs a dynamic estimator of the Hessian inverse, formulated as a Riccati equation, enabling user-assignable convergence rates. The event-triggering mechanism is designed to minimize unnecessary actuation updates while preserving stability and performance. Using averaging theory, we establish local stability results and exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the unknown extremum point. Additionally, numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach over gradient-based and continuously actuated Newton-based extremum seeking, showing improved convergence rates and reduced control update frequency, leading to more efficient implementation in real-time optimization scenarios.",

This technical note proposes a novel \\textit{parallel-in-horizon} and \\textit{construction-free} nonlinear MPC algorithm, termed $\u03c0$MPC, which combines a new variable-splitting scheme with a velocity-based system representation in the ADMM framework, enabling horizon-wise parallel execution while operating directly on system matrices without explicit MPC-to-QP construction.

We investigate the performance of several STS methods, including Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and Runge-Kutta-Legendre (RKL) schemes, applied to a diffusion equation discretized using both discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite-difference methods. To support time adaptivity, we introduce a novel error norm designed to more accurately track temporal error arising from DG spatial discretizations, in which degrees of freedom contribute unevenly to the solution error. Finally, we assess the performance of an automatic eigenvalue estimation algorithm for determining the required number of STS stages and compare it against an analytical estimation formula.",

The resulting rules achieve degrees up to 77 on the square, 45 on the cube, and 30 on the prism and pyramid, and for most degrees use fewer nodes than previously published f-SPI quadrature rules.

This is a special case of a more general framework addressed here -- the asymptotic maximum density of a constant matrix over an arbitrary symbol set, in a large, possibly monotone, matrix. We solve all $2 \\times 2$ monotone cases (one of which corresponds to the aforementioned $P_4$) and all but one of the $2 \\times 2$ unrestricted cases.\n  While $(h!/h^h)^2$ is a lower bound for the asymptotic maximum density of an $h \\times h$ matrix, we explicitly construct, for all $h \\ge 1$, an $h \\times h$ minimizer, i.e., a matrix for which this bound is attained.

Those boundary operators allow to connect the transmission problem (on the whole space) to one-sided problems -- notably, scattering problems -- with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Since an extension domain needs no specific boundary measure, the Robin (impedance) condition is not understood in a boundary L^2-type space, rather by duality on the trace space itself. We discuss the well-posedness of the impedance scattering problem in that framework and compare to the classical L^2 setting. Our analysis allows to generalise optimisation results for acoustic scattering when the obstacle is an extension domain in any dimension.",

    "abstract": "Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) have emerged as a revolutionary architecture for next-generation wireless communications, offering wave-domain signal processing capabilities with significantly reduced hardware complexity compared to conventional systems. However, most existing SIM research assumes continuous phase shifts and perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which are impractical due to hardware discrete phase shift constraints and prohibitive pilot overhead. This paper presents a joint power allocation and discrete phase shift optimization framework for SIM-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output(MISO) downlink systems under statistical CSI. We formulate the achievable sum rate maximization problem considering practical discrete phase constraints and derive a closed-form expression for the average achievable rate under statistical CSI. To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we decouple the problem by using the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm and alternating optimization (AO). Subsequently, we utilize the Lagrangian multiplier method and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to obtain closed-form iterative solutions. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity by a factor of 50 compared to semi-definite relaxation (SDR) methods, , while maintaining over 85% of the continuous phase shift performance with only 1-bit quantization, highlighting its feasibility for low-cost hardware systems.",

We then establish the theoretical foundations for RANDSMAP and introduce its multiscale variant to capture structures across multiple scales. We formulate and derive the closed-form solution of the corresponding constrained optimization problem and prove the mass preservation property. Numerically, we assess the performance of RANDSMAP on three benchmark problems/datasets with mass preservation obtained by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow PDE with shock waves, 2D rotated MRI brain images, and the Hughes crowd dynamics PDEs. We demonstrate that RANDSMAPs yield high reconstruction accuracy at low computational cost and maintain mass conservation at single-machine precision. In its vanilla formulation, the scheme remains applicable to the classical pre-image problem, i.e., when mass-preservation constraints are not imposed.",

This replenishment-based formulation captures operational settings, such as e-commerce fulfillment, perishable supply chains, and renewable-powered systems, where resources are accumulated gradually and initial inventories are small or zero. The introduction of dispersed, uncertain replenishment fundamentally alters the structure of classical OLPs, creating persistent stockout risk and eliminating advance knowledge of the total budget.\n  We develop new algorithms and regret analyses for three major distributional regimes studied in the OLP literature: bounded distributions, finite-support distributions, and continuous-support distributions with a non-degeneracy condition. For bounded distributions, we design an algorithm that achieves $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. For finite-support distributions with a non-degenerate induced LP, we obtain $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ regret, and we establish an $\u03a9(\\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for degenerate instances, demonstrating a sharp separation from the classical setting where $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret is achievable. For continuous-support, non-degenerate distributions, we develop a two-stage accumulate-then-convert algorithm that achieves $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 T)$ regret, comparable to the $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ regret in classical OLPs. Together, these results provide a near-complete characterization of the optimal regret achievable in OLP with replenishment. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms and demonstrate their advantages over natural adaptations of classical OLP methods in the replenishment setting.",

Proving idealness analytically can be extraordinarily tedious -- even for small formulations -- such proofs often span many pages of intricate case analysis which motivates the development of automated verification methods. We develop a general-purpose framework for certifying idealness in Mixed Binary Linear Programs (MBLPs), formulating the verification problem as a linear program when the data is fixed and as a nonconvex quadratic program when the data is parametric. We apply this framework to study several formulations of the rectangle packing problem that are conjectured to be pairwise-ideal, obtaining computational proofs where analytic proofs were previously unknown or impractical. As our second contribution, we introduce and model a novel generalization of the rectangle packing problem that enforces edge clearances between selected rectangles. We present both existing and novel MBLP formulations which arise from different encodings of the underlying disjunctive constraints. We perform some computational experiments on these formulations under a strip-packing objective to determine the importance of pairwise-idealness in practice.",

In 1957, just one year later, J. Nash independently developed analogous techniques for parabolic equations, concurrently with De Giorgi's research. By the year 2000, these techniques had been extended to address elliptic and parabolic equations featuring integral diffusion, such as the fractional Laplacian. More recently, the theory has evolved to encompass kinetic equations, accommodating both local and integral diffusions. This book aims to present these results in a unified and coherent manner, beginning with the classical elliptic framework and progressing through to the most recent advancements in kinetic equations.",

These problems correspond to solve, respectively, the Navier-Stokes and the Euler equations with an additional generalised Lagrange multiplier associated with the threshold on the deformation rate tensor. Applying the continuous dependence of strong and weak solutions to the variational inequalities for the Navier-Stokes with constraints on the derivatives, and on their respective generalised Lagrange multipliers, we can solve the case of the variable threshold depending on the solution itself that correspond to quasi-variational problems.\n  \\vspace{2mm}\n  $$ \\text{Dedicated to Vsevolod Alekseevich Solonnikov, {\\em in memoriam}}$$",

We apply this result to address a fundamental question in polynomial optimization: the existence of a convergent outer hierarchy for problems with inequality constraints and analytical convergence guarantees. Our strategy generalizes a quantitative monogamy-of-entanglement argument from quantum theory to arbitrary convex bodies, establishing a uniform upper bound on mutual information in multipartite extensions. This leads to a finite de Finetti theorem and, subsequently, a convergent conic hierarchy for a wide class of polynomial optimization problems subject to both equality and inequality constraints. We further provide a constructive rounding scheme that yields certified interior points with controlled approximation error. As an application, we express the optimal GPT value of a two-player non-local game as a polynomial optimization problem, allowing our techniques to produce approximation schemes with finite convergence guarantees.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation networks explore the opportunistic assistance of airliner/high-altitude platforms (HAPs) in delivering high data rates for terrestrial networks to ensure consistent and reliable communication. When an airliner/HAP moves at very high speeds, its mobility has a substantial impact on ensuring seamless connectivity, stable signal strength, and reliable data transmission. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been shown to provide notable improvement in performance when handling Doppler effects during high-mobility situations. This paper presents an OTFS-based airplane-aided next-generation networking system. In the proposed system, the airliner/HAPs are equipped with a planar antenna array that applies null steering beamforming (NSB) at the transmitter for communication with terrestrial users. A comprehensive performance comparison between OTFS and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is performed under varying airliner altitude, velocity, array dimension, and Rician factor conditions. The simulation results show that OTFS consistently outperforms OFDM, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) and more stable performance across different airliner altitudes, velocities, array dimensions, and propagation environments.",

    "title": "From carbon management strategies to implementation: Modeling and physical simulation of CO2 pipeline infrastructure - a case study for Germany",
    "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage or utilization (CCUS) will play an important role to achieve climate neutrality in many economies. Pipelines are widely regarded as the most efficient means of CO2 transport; however, they are currently non-existent. Policy-makers and companies need to develop large-scale infrastructure under substantial uncertainty. Methods and analyses are needed to support pipeline planning and strategy development. This paper presents an integrated method for designing CO2 pipeline networks by combining energy system scenarios with physical network simulation. Using Germany as a case study, we derive spatially highly resolved CO2 balances to develop a dense-phase CO2 pipeline topology that follows existing gas pipeline corridors. The analyzed system includes existing sites for cement and lime production, waste incineration, carbon users, four coastal CO2 hubs, and border crossing points. We then apply the multiphysical network simulator MYNTS to assess the technical feasibility of this network. We determine pipeline diameters, pump locations, and operating conditions that ensure stable dense-phase transport. The method explicitly accounts for elevation and possible impurities. The results indicate that a system of about 7000 km pipeline length and a mixed normed diameter of DN700 on main corridors and of DN500/DN400 on branches presents a feasible solution to connect most sites. Investment costs for the optimized pipeline system are calculated to be about 17 billion Euros. The method provides a reproducible framework and is transferable to other countries and to European scope.",

We also begin to investigate reduced Leonard trios, for which the general eigenvalue problem simplifies to a $R_I$-type recurrence relation.

    "abstract": "The classic upper bound on the chromatic number of $d$-degenerate graphs is $d+1$, shown to be tight by complete graphs. A natural question is whether this bound remains tight if one forbids large cliques. Classic constructions of Tutte and Zykov from the early 50s show that there exist $d$-degenerate $(d+1)$-chromatic graphs that are triangle-free, however these constructions grow rapidly with $d$. Motivated by this and addressing a problem posed by the second author at the Oberwolfach Graph Theory workshop, we prove that the minimum order $f(d)$ of a $d$-degenerate triangle-free graph of chromatic number $d+1$ satisfies $e^{\u03a9(d)}\\le f(d)\\le e^{O(d^2\\log d)}.$ The lower bound follows from a novel upper bound on the chromatic number of triangle-free graphs: Every triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph $G$ on $n \\le e^{O(d)}$ vertices satisfies $$\u03c7(G)\\le O\\left(\\frac{d}{\\log\\left(d/\\log n\\right)}\\right).$$ We extend this to a more general result about degenerate graphs with sparse neighborhoods, which has applications to many graph coloring problems: For example, we prove that every counterexample to Hadwiger's conjecture with parameter $t$ must have a complete bipartite subgraph with one exponentially large side ($K_{a,b}$ where $a=(\\log t)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $b=e^{t^{1-o(1)}}$) or a small and very dense subgraph (of order $\\le t$ with $t^{2-o(1)}$ edges) in some neighborhood.\n  For the upper bound on $f(d)$ we establish a surprising connection between $f(d)$ and the on-line-chromatic number $g(n)$ of $n$-vertex triangle-free graphs. We also give an asymptotic improvement of the previous best upper bound for $g(n)$ due to Lov\u00e1sz, Saks and Trotter from 1989.\n  Along the way we disprove a generalization of Harris' fractional coloring conjecture to graphs of bounded clique number and raise numerous problems which open up interesting directions to explore for future research.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates a stochastic version of a class of non-Newtonian fluids governed by third-grade fluid equations, which exhibit complex and highly nonlinear dynamics. In particular, we address the random dynamics and asymptotic behavior of stochastic third-grade fluid equations (STGFEs) driven by a \\emph{linear multiplicative It\u00f4-type white noise} on general domains $\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\\in\\{2,3\\}$. We first prove that the non-autonomous STGFEs generate a continuous non-autonomous random dynamical system $\u03a6$, and we establish the existence of a pullback absorbing set. Using compact Sobolev embeddings on bounded domains and uniform tail estimates on unbounded domains, we show the pullback asymptotic compactness of $\u03a6$, which leads to the existence of pullback random attractors that are compact and attracting in $\\mathbb{L}^2(\\mathbb{Q})$. As a consequence, we demonstrate the existence of an invariant measure associated with the STGFEs and, exploiting the linear multiplicative structure of the noise along with the exponential stability of solutions, we prove uniqueness of the invariant measure in the case of zero external forcing. These results are entirely new for STGFEs on general domains, and, in particular, the existence of pullback random attractors with linear multiplicative noise is obtained here for the first time. We further note that, unlike Stratonovich noise, which is widely used in the literature to study random attractors, It\u00f4 noise is more appropriate for domains that do not satisfy the Poincar\u00e9 inequality. Overall, this work resolves several open problems regarding random attractors, invariant measures, and ergodicity for stochastic third-grade fluids on general unbounded domains $\\mathbb{Q}\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\\in\\{2,3\\}$.",

Originally introduced by Bryant as the verbal topology, it serves as a fundamental tool for investigating the topological structure of infinite groups and is always a $T_1$ topology with continuous shifts and inversion. Since the Zariski topology is coarser than every Hausdorff group topology on G, it provides a natural starting point for topologizing groups; specifically, for countable or abelian groups, it is known that the Zariski topology coincides with the Markov topology-the intersection of all Hausdorff group topologies on G.\n  In this paper, we analyze the Zariski topology on various homeomorphism groups. We demonstrate that for the Thompson groups F and T, the Zariski (and thus Markov) topology coincides with the standard compact-open topology derived from their respective actions on $[0,1]$ and $S^1$. In contrast, we show that the Zariski (and thus Markov) topology on Thompson's group V is irreducible, and therefore neither Hausdorff nor a group topology. As V acts highly transitively on each of its orbits, this result stands in notable opposition to a theorem by Banakh et al, which establishes that the Zariski topology on any permutation group containing all finitely supported elements is a Hausdorff group topology.\n  We also extend these investigations to Homeo$([0,1])$, Homeo$(S^1)$, and Homeo$(2^\u03c9)$. We conclude by providing a classification of the topological manifolds $M$ for which the homeomorphism group Homeo$(M)$ admits a Hausdorff Zariski topology.",

The evolution of the system is therefore determined by the choice of a constitutive characterization for these constraints, a choice that restores mechanical determinism and eliminates any paradoxical aspects of the system's behavior, in agreement with experimental evidence. It is shown that, similarly to what occurs in general non ideal impulsive systems, the choice of a constitutive characterization of the constraint system depends on the determination of two numerical coefficients $\u03c3$ and $\u03b2$, which depend on the kinematic and mass-related data of the system, and possibly also on physical quantities not strictly of a mechanical nature, such as material properties. The simplicity of the model also allows for a straightforward experimental analysis of the system's behavior and for the experimental determination of the values of these coefficients.",

While classical absorbing conditions work well for wave propagation, they prove insufficient for damped wave equations, particularly in viscoelastic damping regimes where convergence becomes prohibitively slow. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a more general transmission operator with two free parameters for the one-dimensional damped wave equation. Through frequency-domain analysis, we derive an explicit expression for the convergence factor governing the convergence rate. We propose and compare two optimization strategies (L-infinity and L-2 minimization) for determining optimal transmission parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our optimized approach significantly accelerates convergence compared to standard absorbing conditions, especially for viscoelastic damping cases.

Furthermore, as an application of our results, we demonstrate that, under certain conditions, a $\u03b4$-nodal curve on a Hirzebruch surface $\\mathbb{F}_{n}$ cannot be embedded as $\u03b4-$nodal curve on a different Hirzebruch surface $\\mathbb{F}_{m}$, for $n\\neq m$.",

The pairwise relationships between these algebras are encoded by a graph with two edge sets -- a combinatorial structure we call a bigraph -- and naturally encompass the five fundamental types of independence: tensor, free, (anti)monotone, and Boolean. It subsumes the BMT independence of Arizmendi--Mendoza--Vazquez-Becerra (when all pairwise relationships are Boolean, (anti)monotone, or tensor) and the $\u03b5$ or $\u039b$-independence of Mlotkowski (when the pairwise relationships are tensor and free). We present explicit combinatorial moment formulas, a Hilbert space construction, and natural associativity relations within this setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that bigraph independence emerges in the asymptotic behavior of tensor product random matrix models with respect to a vector state, encompassing the Charlesworth--Collins model for $\\varepsilon$-independence as a special case and offering a random matrix perspective on BMT independence.",

We show that solutions to these equations have a partial regularity estimate which captures differences of the solution up to the scale at which the kernel has a truncation in its singularity. The estimates we provide are robust with respect to the truncation parameter, and they include the existing results for the original operators without truncation. There are some earlier results for linear and elliptic cases of this situation of integrable interaction kernels, and so our work is a generalization of those to the nonlinear and parabolic setting.",

This work presents a first-principles framework inherent to Bayesian updating, termed information mechanics (infomechanics). Any pointwise reduction in posterior surprisal is exactly balanced by information gained from data, independently of algorithms, dynamics, or implementation. Imposing additivity, symmetry, and robustness collapses the freedom of this identity to only two independent conservation relations. One governs the global redistribution of uncertainty and recovers Shannon entropy. The other captures a complementary local geometric component, formalised as Fisher information. Together, these conserved quantities motivate a non-additive state function, the information potential $\u03a6$, which isolates structural degrees of freedom beyond entropy while remaining invariant under reparametrisation. $\u03a6$ quantifies local sharpness and ruggedness in posterior beliefs and vanishes uniquely for isotropic Gaussian distributions. In a low-temperature regime, $\u03a6$ scales logarithmically with the effective number of local optima, linking information geometry to computational complexity. This formalises an information-computation exchange, whereby information acquisition reshapes the inference landscape and reduces computational demands. By separating invariant informational constraints from inference mechanisms, this framework provides a unified, algorithm-independent foundation for inference, learning, and computation across biological and artificial systems.",

It is shown that specific polynomial equations having \"hidden\" symmetries can be reduced to classical symmetric systems of polynomial equations by introducing a new additional variable. It has been established that symmetric systems of polynomial equations of mixed type, consisting of symmetric and anti-symmetric polynomials, can be transformed into simpler systems. A method is presented for solving nonclassical symmetric systems of two polynomial equations that change places when the unknowns are permuted. We study polynomial equations containing the second iteration of a given polynomial, which are reduced to nonclassical symmetric systems of equations. New higher-degree polynomial equations containing free parameters that admit solutions in radicals are found. Three such equations of the sixth and ninth degrees are further used as test problems with parameters for analyzing the capabilities of two leading computer algebra systems. It is shown that currently, the Maple and Mathematica systems do not allow us to efficiently find analytical solutions (in radicals) of polynomial equations with free parameters, but they allow us to obtain numerical solutions of equations for fixed numerical values of the parameters. The results of this work and the proposed test problems with parameters can be used to further improve existing computer algebra systems.",

The main outcome is a center-outward ordering of the observations that can be used both to highlight features of the underlying distribution of the data and as input to further statistical analysis. An important property of data depth is related to symmetric distributions as the point with the highest depth value, the center, coincides with the point of symmetry. However, there are applications in which it is more natural to consider symmetry with respect to a subspace of a certain dimension rather than to a point, i.e. a subspace of dimension zero. We provide a general framework to construct statistical data depths which attain maximum value in a subspace, providing a center-outward ordering from that subspace. We refer to these data depths as central subspace data depths. Moreover, if the distribution is symmetric with respect to a subspace, then the depth is maximized at that subspace. We introduce general notions of symmetry about a subspace for distributions, study the properties of central subspace data depths and provide asymptotic convergence for the corresponding sample versions. Additionally, we discuss connections with projection pursuit and dimension reduction. An application based on custom data fraud detection shows the importance of the proposed approach and strengthens its potential.",

We then consider the system under stochastic perturbations, specifically infinite-dimensional additive white noise. In this random setting, we do not find conclusive evidence that the corresponding random attractor remains a single point, as in the deterministic case.

Using the notion of actors between groupoids, we show that under natural hypotheses, embeddings between reduced $L^p$-groupoid algebras can be described entirely in terms of morphisms of the underlying groupoids. We further show that embeddings of $L^p$-groupoid algebras induce embeddings of the associated topological full groups. Our results provide new tools for studying embeddability questions in the $L^p$-setting, and are particularly helpful when ruling out the existence of embeddings.\n  As applications, we obtain strong rigidity results for (spatial) $L^p$-AF-embeddability, showing that, for $p\\neq 2$, an $L^p$-groupoid algebra embeds into a spatial $L^p$-AF-algebra if and only if the underlying groupoid is AF.

Then, the OFDM channel estimation is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem in the TF domain according to the dictionary derived based on the obtained delay and Doppler estimates. Furthermore, a low-complexity $\\ell_1$-regularized least-square estimator is proposed to effectively solve this problem. Moreover, we further develop a performance analysis framework of the proposed scheme based on the ambiguity function (AF) of the adopted pilot sequence.

    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to establish a local rigidity result for the integrability of standard-like maps. The main focus of the paper is the remarkable integrable potential discovered by Suris in the 80's. We show that locally, the integrability of this potential is rigid. The proof relies on a similar strategy that was used for billiards in an ellipse, and involves developing the action-angle coordinates for this system, and exploiting it to construct a Riesz basis for $L^2$. As a corollary, we obtain a spectral rigidity result for this setting. Finally, we study the integrability question in the setting of potentials that are periodic.",

In general, a bundle is the set of $n\\times n$ real matrices with the same real Jordan canonical form, up to the values of the eigenvalues, provided that the eigenvalues which are distinct in one matrix of the bundle remain distinct in any other matrix of the same bundle. The $k$th generic bundle, for $0\\leq k\\leq\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$, contains the $n\\times n$ real matrices having $k$ different pairs of non-real conjugate eigenvalues and $n-2k$ different real eigenvalues. We prove that each of the $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor+1$ generic bundles is an open subset of the set of $n\\times n$ real matrices. Some numerical experiments are carried out with large sets of random matrices of different sizes to confirm that all the generic bundles show up, and only these ones.",

We extend the Parareal algorithm to this setting and propose three coarse propagators: monolithic, fixed-stress, and multirate fixed-stress schemes.

The proposed path optimal experimental design (path-OED) framework is established rigorously in a function space setting and elaborated for the case of Bayesian c-optimality, which quantifies the posterior variance in a linear functional of the inverse parameter. The latter is motivated by goal-oriented formulations, where we seek to minimize the uncertainty in a scalar prediction of interest. To facilitate computations, we complement the proposed infinite-dimensional framework with discretized formulations, in suitably weighted finite-dimensional inner product spaces, and derive efficient methods for finding optimal sensor paths. The resulting computational framework is flexible, scalable, and can be adapted to a broad range of linear inverse problems and design criteria. We also present extensive computational experiments, for a model inverse problem constrained by an advection-diffusion equation, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "The first non-zero Laplace eigenvalue of a hyperbolic surface, or its spectral gap, measures how well-connected the surface is: surfaces with a large spectral gap are hard to cut in pieces, have a small diameter and fast mixing times. For large hyperbolic surfaces (of large area or large genus $g$, equivalently), we know that the spectral gap is asymptotically bounded above by $\\frac 14$. The aim of these talks is to present joint work with Nalini Anantharaman, where we prove that most hyperbolic surfaces have a near-optimal spectral gap. That is to say, we prove that, for any $\u03b5> 0$, the Weil--Petersson probability for a hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ to have a spectral gap greater than $\\frac 14- \u03b5$ goes to one as $g$ goes to infinity. This statement is analogous to Alon's 1986 conjecture for regular graphs, proven by Friedman in 2003. I will present our approach, which shares many similarities with Friedman's work, and introduce new tools and ideas that we have developed in order to tackle this problem.",

While KdV and the gauged equation are equivalent for smooth solutions, the latter is better behaved at low regularity in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces. In particular, the admissible regularities go beyond the $H^{-1}$-scale, which is a well-known threshold for KdV. As a byproduct, by reversing the gauge transform, we are able to improve on the known theory for KdV and derive sharp local well-posedness in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces with large integrability exponent. Our strategy is based on an infinite normal form reduction and Fourier restriction estimates, together with a thorough exploitation of algebraic cancellations. Additionally, our method is totally independent of the KdV completely integrable structure, and extends to other non-integrable models with quadratic nonlinearities.",

    "title": "Towards Standardizing OTFS: A Candidate Waveform for Next-Generation Wireless Networks",
    "abstract": "The standardization of the sixth-generation (6G) has recently commenced to address the rapidly growing demands for enhanced wireless network services. Nevertheless, existing wireless systems, particularly at the physical layer waveform level, remain inadequate for achieving the ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) envisioned for 6G. Specifically, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), the widely adopted waveform in fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) networks, suffers from inherent limitations in satisfying these stringent requirements. In practice, OFDM can experience severe inter-carrier interference (ICI), resulting in a pronounced data rate error floor caused by high Doppler shifts. Additionally, the repetitive usage of cyclic prefixes (CPs), intended to combat multipath delays, results in significant spectral inefficiency. These fundamental drawbacks pose critical obstacles to fulfilling 6G performance objectives. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a promising waveform candidate, addressing the aforementioned challenges by exploiting the unique characteristics of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel. Unlike OFDM, OTFS is inherently resilient to channel distortions induced by delay and Doppler effects, while remaining sensitive to time and frequency shifts. Such intrinsic properties are instrumental in enabling OTFS, with joint communication and sensing capabilities, to embrace, rather than combat, dynamic channel conditions. Motivated by these compelling advantages, this article investigates the feasibility and practical implementation of OTFS modulation leveraging the current OFDM-based wireless systems.",

We do not know if this is sharp, but we do show that for any suspension flow of this kind, quantitative weak mixing with a polynomial rate is impossible. Results for specific systems are often much weaker than for ``typical'' or ``generic'' ones. In the Appendix we explain how a minor modification of an argument from Bufetov and Solomyak (2014) yields very weak, but nevertheless quantitative weak mixing estimates of $\\log^*$ type for the {\\em self-similar} suspension flow over a Salem substitution. Simultaneously this provides first quantitative decay rates for the Fourier transform of Salem Bernoulli convolutions.",
