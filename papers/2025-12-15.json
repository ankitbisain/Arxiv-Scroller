    "abstract": "In this work we introduce a family of transformations, named \\textit{divergence transformations}, interpolating between any pair of probability density functions sharing the same support. We prove the remarkable property that the whole family of Kullback-Leibler and R\u00e9nyi divergences evolves in a monotone way with respect to the transformation parameter. Moreover, fixing the reference density, we show that the divergence transformations enjoy a group structure and can be derived through the algebraic conjugation of the recently introduced differential-escort transformations and their relative counterparts.\n  This algebraic structure allows us to deform any density function in such a way its divergence with respect a fixed reference density might also increase as much as possible. We also establish the monotonicity of composed measures involving the proper Kullback-Leibler and R\u00e9nyi divergences as well as other recently introduced relative measures of moment and Fisher types.\n  As applications, an approximation scheme of general density functions by simple functions is provided. In addition, we give a number of analytical and numerical examples of interest in both regimes of increasing and decreasing divergence.",

    "abstract": "Safe Bayesian optimization (BO) with Gaussian processes is an effective tool for tuning control policies in safety-critical real-world systems, specifically due to its sample efficiency and safety guarantees. However, most safe BO algorithms assume homoscedastic sub-Gaussian measurement noise, an assumption that does not hold in many relevant applications. In this article, we propose a straightforward yet rigorous approach for safe BO across noise models, including homoscedastic sub-Gaussian and heteroscedastic heavy-tailed distributions. We provide a high-probability bound on the measurement noise via the scenario approach, integrate these bounds into high probability confidence intervals, and prove safety and optimality for our proposed safe BO algorithm. We deploy our algorithm in synthetic examples and in tuning a controller for the Franka Emika manipulator in simulation.",

A coalition partition of $G$ is its vertex partition $\u03c0$ such that every non-dominating set of $\u03c0$ is a member of some coalition, and every dominating set is a single-vertex set in $\u03c0$. The coalition number $C(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum cardinality of its coalition partitions. A subset $R \\subseteq V$ is a restrained dominating set if $R$ is a dominating set and any vertex of $V \\setminus R$ has at least one neighbor in $V \\setminus R$. Restrained dominating coalition, restrained dominating partition and restrained coalition number $RC(G)$ are defined by the same way.

Adopting an \"optimize-then-discretize\" strategy, we first apply a constraint-preserving continuous Riemannian gradient flow on an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, which is subsequently mapped to the neural network parameter space via Galerkin projection. This process naturally induces a Sobolev energy metric that incorporates physical information, effectively mitigating stiffness during optimization. To address the explicit dependence on the normalization constant caused by the nonlinear interaction term in the GPE, we design a hybrid sampling strategy combining an integration stream and a MCMC stream to achieve precise estimation of the generalized Gram matrix and energy gradients. Numerical experiments on benchmark cases, including the harmonic oscillator potential in the strong interaction limit and multi-scale optical lattice potentials, demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed method. Furthermore, it achieves an order-of-magnitude acceleration in convergence compared to standard optimizers like Adam, exhibiting superior robustness in handling strong nonlinearities and complex geometric constraints.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the linear quadratic control (LQC) design of systems corrupted by both stochastic noise and bounded noise simultaneously. When only of these noises are considered, the LQC strategy leads to stochastic or robust controllers, respectively. However, there is no LQC strategy that can simultaneously handle stochastic and bounded noises efficiently. This limits the scope where existing LQC strategies can be applied. In this work, we look into the LQC problem for discrete-time systems that have both stochastic and bounded noises in its dynamics. We develop a state estimation for such systems by efficiently combining a Kalman filter and an ellipsoid set-membership filter. The developed state estimation can recover the estimation optimality when the system is subject to both kinds of noise, the stochastic and the bounded. Upon the estimated state, we derive a robust state-feedback optimal control law for the LQC problem. The control law derivation takes into account both stochastic and bounded-state estimation errors, so as to avoid over-conservativeness while sustaining stability in the control. In this way, the developed LQC strategy extends the range of scenarios where LQC can be applied, especially those of real-world control systems with diverse sensing which are subject to different kinds of noise. We present numerical simulations, and the results demonstrate the enhanced control performance with the proposed strategy.",

For mean field games with a class of such Hamiltonians, we prove existence of solutions for the mean field games system of partial differential equations, allowing pseudomeasure data for the distribution of agents. Specifically, this allows the initial distribution of agents to be a sum of Dirac masses. The existence theorem requires a smallness condition on the size of the terminal data for the value function (or, alternatively, on the size of the Hamiltonian); no smallness condition on the size of the initial data or on the size of the time horizon is required. We also prove uniqueness and continuous dependence results under the same type of smallness conditions.

We regard admissible operators as square-integrable maps with respect to a fixed approximation measure, and we measure reconstruction error in the corresponding Bochner norm. For a finite-dimensional approximation space $V$ of dimension $N$, we study weighted least squares estimators in $V$ and establish probabilistic stability and accuracy bounds in the Bochner norm. We show that there exist sampling measures and weights - defined via an operator-level Christoffel function - that yield uniformly well-conditioned Gram matrices and near-optimal sample complexity, with a number of training samples $M$ on the order of $N \\log N$. We complement the analysis by constructing explicit operator approximation spaces in cases of interest: rank-one linear operators that are dense in the class of bounded linear operators, and rank-one polynomial operators that are dense in the Bochner space under mild assumptions on the approximation measure. For both families we describe implementable procedures for sampling from the associated optimal measures. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on several benchmark problems, including learning solution operators for the Poisson equation, viscous Burgers' equation, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.",

Specifically, we focus on the short-range Hamiltonians with ergodic disordered on-site potentials. We first introduce the bulk and edge indices, which are both well-defined within the Aizenman-Molchanov mobility gap. On the one hand, the bulk index is the sum of the Hall conductance, which is a well-studied quantized topological number, and an additional contribution from the bulk-localized modes as a consequence of the Anderson localization. On the other hand, the edge index, which characterizes the averaged angular momentum of waves in the mobility gap, is uniquely associated with finite systems. Our main result proves that as the sample size tends to infinity, the edge index converges to the bulk index almost surely. Our findings provide a rigorous foundation for the bulk-edge correspondence principle for finite disordered systems. The existence of the Aizenman-Molchanov mobility gap is proved by the geometric decoupling method, introduced by Aizenman and Molchanov [Comm. Math. Phys., 1993], under a rational assumption on the distribution of the random potential. For completeness, all assumptions are checked on a prototypical model for (quantum) anomalous Hall physics.",

First, we introduce the resource theory that directly quantifies causal influence of a functional dependence in this setting and show that the problem of deciding convertibility of resources and identifying a complete set of monotones has a relatively straightforward solution. Following this, we introduce the resource theory that arises naturally when one has uncertainty about the functional dependence. We describe a linear program for deciding the question of whether one resource (i.e., state of knowledge about the functional dependence) can be converted to another. Then, we focus on the case where the variables are binary. In this case, we identify a triple of monotones that are complete in the sense that they capture the partial order over the set of all resources, and we provide an interpretation of each.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel bond-based peridynamic model that utilizes a Gaussian kernel function. Previous peridynamic models, when directly discretized, have exhibited a lack of asymptotically compatibility with their corresponding local elastic solutions. Additionally, these models have faced challenges in accurately computing the volume of intersecting regions between the horizon of the material point and its neighboring cells. These difficulties in numerical simulations within peridynamics have spurred numerous efforts to develop corrective numerical methods. While such corrective methods have addressed certain issues, they remain complex to formulate and computationally intensive. Instead of addressing these challenges through modified numerical discretization, this paper presents a novel approach: bond-based peridynamics with a Gaussian kernel . This model replaces the bounded kernel function commonly used in existing peridynamic models with an unbounded Gaussian kernel function. Through direct meshfree discretization, we demonstrate that the solution of the proposed model , without the need for compatibility correction or volume correction, aligns with the corresponding local elastic solution. Furthermore, we derive the relevant material parameters based on energy equivalence to an elastic continuum model. Building upon this foundation, we propose a damage model and a linearized version of the proposed peridynamic model. We validate our proposed model through simulations of 2D smooth problems, demonstrating its convergence and accuracy. Finally, we assess the applicability of our approach to realistic scenarios by predicting displacements caused by a 2D plate with pre-existing cracks and replicating high-velocity impact results from the Kalthoff-Winkler experiments.",

The discrete nature of the constraints precludes the use of continuous optimization algorithms. Therefore, we begin by relaxing the binary constraints into continuous box constraints and incorporate an l1/2 regularization term to drive the relaxed variables toward binary values. We prove that when the regularization parameter is larger than a threshold, the regularized problem is equivalent to the original problem: they share identical local and global minima, and all Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the regularized problem are feasible assignment matrices. To solve the regularized problem approximately and efficiently, we adopt the variable splitting technique, and solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, in which all subproblems admit closed-form solutions. Detailed theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's convergence, and finite-step termination under certain conditions. Finally, the algorithm is validated on various numerical tests.",

First, we establish a Gibbs-type variational formulation of the rate-distortion function and show that optimal test channels form an exponential family, with Fullback-Leibler divergence acting as a Bregman divergence. This yields a generalized Pythagorean theorem for projections and a Legendre duality that couples distortion constraints with inverse temperature parameters. Second, the reverse water-filling metaphor is extended to distributed lattice quantization, deriving distortion allocation bounds across eigenmodes of conditional covariance matrices. Third, inference is formalized as decoding by showing that belief propagation in LDPC ensembles and polarization in polar codes can be interpreted as recursive variational inference procedures. These results unify compression, quantization, and decoding as convex projections of continuous information onto discrete manifolds. Extensions to neural compression and quantum information are sketched as corollaries, illustrating the universality of the framework. Illustrative connections to other scientific fields are also presented. Finally, complementary numerical examples and scripts are located in the appendix",

We follow on to explore minimum conditions for well-posedness and conclude that the full elastic strain tensor within an isotropic sample can be uniquely reconstructed from three measured components; specifically the three shear components, or the three diagonal components. We further prove two key results related to eigenstrain reconstruction in a general sense; 1. That any possible residual stress field can be generated by a diagonal eigenstrain and 2. That residual stress fields exist that cannot be generated by isotropic eigenstrains. Together, these findings establish rigorous minimum experimental and computational requirements for well-posed eigenstrain tomography techniques and inverse eigenstrain problems in general.",

A classical result of Ren\u00e9 Thom asserts that if $I$ is a finitely generated \u0141ojasiewicz ideal, then $Z(I)$ contains an open dense subset of smooth points. The goal of this note is to examine a converse question: does the existence of an open dense set of smooth points in $Z(I)$ ( $I\\subset\\mathcal{E}(\u03a9) $ is a finitely generated ideal) imply that the ideal $I$ is \u0141ojasiewicz? We analyze obstructions to such a converse and identify geometric conditions under which it fails.\n  As an application, we study smooth real-valued functions of two variables whose zero set coincides with the classical Hawaiian earring, the union of infinitely many tangent circles accumulating at the origin. We show that any such function must be flat at the origin, in the sense that all partial derivatives vanish there. We formulate a geometric criterion concerning families of smooth arcs tangent at a point with unbounded or infinitely varying curvature, and derive from it a degenerate form of the \u0141ojasiewicz inequality adapted to this non-analytic setting.",

Let $k$ be a perfect field of positive characteristic $p$ and equip $S=\\operatorname{Spec}k$ with the trivial log structure. For a log smooth scheme $X$ over $S,$ we obtain, under the assumption that the exact relative Frobenius lifts to the Witt vectors, a fully faithful functor from the category of quasi-coherent modules on the base change $X'=X\\times_{S,F_S}S$ of $X$ by the Frobenius $F_S$ of $S,$ equipped with a quasi-nilpotent Higgs field, to the category of quasi-coherent modules on $X$ equipped with a quasi-nilpotent integrable connection. In another direction, we construct crystalline-like topoi and subcategories of crystals $\\mathcal{C}'$ and $\\underline{\\mathcal{C}},$ equivalent respectively to modules with Higgs fields and integrable connections, and a fully faithful functor $\\mathcal{C}' \\rightarrow \\underline{\\mathcal{C}}.$ Since the Frobenius morphism is not, in general, flat in the log smooth setting, it is not clear that these functors are essentially surjective. To address this issue, we refine the topoi and crystals mentioned above by endowing them with an indexed structure, inspired by Lorenzon's extension of Cartier descent to smooth logarithmic schemes. Using the Azumaya property of the ring of logarithmic differential operators, we then obtain an equivalence between the corresponding categories of indexed crystals, thereby generalizing the Cartier transform.",

Despite its popularity, AHP has been repeatedly criticised for rank reversal, a phenomenon in which the ranking of alternatives changes after the addition or removal of an irrelevant or duplicate alternative.\n  This paper introduces a new type of rank reversal in AHP, arising when the intensity of preferences is uniformly increased. We show that even when all pairwise preferences preserve their direction and are intensified identically, the eigenvector method may produce a different ordering of alternatives. In contrast, the geometric mean (GM) method is robust to this intensity-of-preference (IOP) rank reversal.\n  The applicability of this result is shown through a real decision-making problem taken from a NASA manual concerning capability prioritisation for the planned lunar Gateway orbital station.",

The main advantage of the moving grid is that the algorithm can deal well with cases where the domain boundaries are time-dependent and the simulation domain contains rigid objects. Due to the irregular nature of the grid, we use a novel meshless MUSCL-like Moving Least Squares Method (MLS) for spatial discretisation coupled with a higher-order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta method. To avoid spurious oscillations at discontinuities, we use the so-called Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) method with an adapted criterion to relax the discrete maximum property. Finally, we employ a new implementation of the boundary conditions that requires no iterative or extrapolation procedure. The method achieves fourth-order in 1D and second-order in 2D for simulations with moving boundaries. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness on classical test cases such as the driven square cavity, shear layer, and shock tube.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces computationally efficient methods for synthesizing explicit piecewise affine (PWA) feedback laws for nonlinear discrete-time systems, ensuring robustness and performance guarantees. The approach proceeds by optimizing a configuration-constrained PWA approximation of the value function of an infinite-horizon min-max Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Here, robustness and performance are maintained by enforcing the PWA approximation to be a generalized control Lyapunov function for the given nonlinear system. This enables the generation of feedback laws with configurable storage complexity and pre-determined evaluation times, based on a selected configuration template. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through a constrained Van der Pol oscillator case study, where an explicit PWA controller with certified ergodic performance and specified complexity is synthesized over a large operational domain.",

    "abstract": "The Linear Arboricity Conjecture asserts that the linear arboricity of a graph with maximum degree $\u0394$ is $\\lceil (\u0394+1)/2 \\rceil$. For a $2k$-regular graph $G$, this implies $la(G) = k+1$. In this note, we utilize a network flow construction to establish upper bounds on $la(G)$ conditioned on the girth $g(G)$. We prove that if $g(G) \\ge 2k$, the conjecture holds true, i.e., $la(G) \\le k+1$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for graphs with girth $g(G)$ at least $k$, $k/2$, $k/4$ and $2k/c$ for any integer constant $c$, the linear arboricity $la(G)$ satisfies the upper bounds $k+2$, $k+3$, $k+5$ and $k+\\left\\lceil \\frac{3c+2}{2}\\right\\rceil$, respectively. Our approach relies on decomposing the graph into $k$ edge-disjoint 2-factors and constructing an auxiliary flow network with lower bound constraints to identify a sparse transversal subgraph that intersects every cycle in the decomposition.",

Our concrete algebra is constructed from the double cosets of the unipotent subgroup within the full matrix monoid. We show that this double coset decomposition is indexed by the framed symmetric inverse monoid. We also define the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra as an abstract structure using generators and relations. We then prove the main isomorphism theorem, which establishes that this abstract algebra is isomorphic to the framed rook algebra under a specific parameter specialization. To complete our characterization, we provide a faithful representation on a tensor space and establish a linear basis for the Rook Yokonuma-Hecke algebra.",

Not all the irreducible representations of these groups have to be taken into account however, the ones that should be considered form the Helffer-Nourrigat cone. This space thus plays the role of a phase space in subriemannian geometry. Its topology is however very singular, preventing any kind of geometry on it. We propose a way to desingularize it. The unitary spectrum of a nilpotent group can be stratified into strata that are locally compact Hausdorff, following Puckansky and Pedersen. We show how this stratification extends to the whole Helffer-Nourrigat cone.

    "abstract": "With the widespread adoption of millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) in vehicular networks, accurate beam prediction and alignment have become critical for high-speed data transmission and reliable access. While traditional beam prediction approaches primarily rely on in-band beam training, recent advances have started to explore multimodal sensing to extract environmental semantics for enhanced prediction. However, the performance of existing multimodal fusion methods degrades significantly in real-world settings because they are vulnerable to missing data caused by sensor blockage, poor lighting, or GPS dropouts. To address this challenge, we propose AMBER ({A}daptive multimodal {M}ask transformer for {BE}am p{R}ediction), a novel end-to-end framework that processes temporal sequences of image, LiDAR, radar, and GPS data, while adaptively handling arbitrary missing-modality cases. AMBER introduces learnable modality tokens and a missing-modality-aware mask to prevent cross-modal noise propagation, along with a learnable fusion token and multihead attention to achieve robust modality-specific information distillation and feature-level fusion. Furthermore, a class-former-aided modality alignment (CMA) module and temporal-aware positional embedding are incorporated to preserve temporal coherence and ensure semantic alignment across modalities, facilitating the learning of modality-invariant and temporally consistent representations for beam prediction. Extensive experiments on the real-world DeepSense6G dataset demonstrate that AMBER significantly outperforms existing multimodal learning baselines. In particular, it maintains high beam prediction accuracy and robustness even under severe missing-modality scenarios, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability.",

The model involved the transport equation with a stochastic source function and a linearly increasing fluidisation rate, with the overflow solids being collected in a finite number of increments (bags). Deconvolution of this data is an ill-posed problem and regularisation is required to provide feasible solutions. Deconvolution with regularisation is applied to a synthetic feed consisting of particles of constant density that vary in size only. It was found that the feed size distribution could be successfully deconvolved from the bag weights, with an accuracy that improved as the rate acceleration of the fluidisation rate was decreased. The deconvolution error only grew linearly with error in the measured bag masses. It was also shown that combining data from two different liquids can improve the accuracy.",

It is challenging to establish the inviscid limit over large time periods for the incompressible Euler equations under the influence of the weak dissipative mechanism generated by the friction force. We first prove the global stability of the equilibrium, in the sense that initial perturbations with appropriate Besov spatial regularity lead to global well-posedness and uniform regularity estimates with respect to the viscosity coefficient for strong solutions of the inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations. In particular, we establish the optimal rates of convergence to equilibrium uniformly in Navier-Stokes. Then, we construct global solutions to the inhomogeneous Euler-Fokker-Planck equations via the vanishing viscosity limit. Furthermore, by capturing the dissipation arising from two-phase interactions, we rigorously justify the global-in-time strong convergence of the inviscid limit process, with a convergence rate that is in sharp contrast to that in the pure incompressible fluid case. To achieve this global convergence, novel ideas and new techniques are developed in the analysis and may be applied to other significant problems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the paradigm of sphere decoding (SD) for solving the integer least square problem (ILS) is revisited, where extra degrees of freedom are introduced to exploit the decoding potential. Firstly, the equivalent sphere decoding (ESD) is proposed, which is essentially the same with the classic Fincke-Pohst sphere decoding but characterizes the sphere radius $D>0$ with two new parameters named as initial searching size $K>1$ and deviation factor $\u03c3>0$. By fixing $\u03c3$ properly, we show that given the sphere radius $D\\triangleq\u03c3\\sqrt{2\\ln K}$, the complexity of ESD in terms of the number of visited nodes is upper bounded by $|S|<nK$, thus resulting in an explicit and tractable decoding trade-off solely controlled by $K$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the complexity of sphere decoding is exactly specified, where considerable decoding potential can be explored from it. After that, two enhancement mechanisms named as normalized weighting and candidate protection are proposed to further upgrade the ESD algorithm. On one hand, given the same setups of $K$ and $\u03c3$, a larger sphere radius is achieved, indicating a better decoding trade-off. On the other hand, the proposed ESD algorithm is generalized, which bridges suboptimal and optimal decoding performance through the flexible choice of $K$. Finally, further performance optimization and complexity reduction with respect to ESD are also derived, and the introduced tractable and flexible decoding trade-off is verified through large-scale MIMO detection.",

Starting from the Quillen-exact category $\\mathcal{C} := T\\text{-Mod}^{\\mathrm{bi}}$ of bi-finite, slot-sensitive $n$-ary $\u0393$-modules introduced earlier, we define the higher K-groups $K_{n}(T,\u0393)$ via Quillen's Q-construction~\\cite{Quillen73} on $\\mathcal{C}$ and via Waldhausen's $S_{\\bullet}$-construction~\\cite{Waldhausen85} on the Waldhausen category of bounded chain complexes in $\\mathcal{C}$. We prove a Gillet--Waldhausen type comparison theorem~\\cite{GilletGrayson87} showing that the resulting Quillen and Waldhausen K-theory spectra are canonically weakly equivalent. Using dg-enhancements and the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the non-commutative spectrum $\\operatorname{Spec}_{T}^{\\mathrm{nc}}(T)$~\\cite{Gokavarapu_JRMS_2266}, we further identify these spectra with the K-theory of the small stable $\\infty$-category of perfect complexes~\\cite{Thomason90}. As consequences, we obtain functoriality, localization, and excision sequences~\\cite{Weibel13}, and a derived Morita invariance statement for $K_{n}(T,\u0393)$~\\cite{Keller94}. These results show that algebraic K-theory of non-commutative $n$-ary $\u0393$-semirings is a derived-geometric invariant of $\\operatorname{Spec}_\u0393^{\\mathrm{nc}}(T)$ and reduce concrete computations to geometric d\u00e9vissage and homological techniques developed in the earlier papers of the series.",

    "abstract": "We study the recovery of low-rank Hermitian matrices from rank-one measurements obtained by uniform sampling from complex projective 3-designs, using nuclear-norm minimization. This framework includes phase retrieval as a special case via the PhaseLift method. In general, complex projective $t$-designs provide a practical means of partially derandomizing Gaussian measurement models. While near-optimal recovery guarantees are known for $4$-designs, and it is known that $2$-designs do not permit recovery with a subquadratic number of measurements, the case of $3$-designs has remained open. In this work, we close this gap by establishing recovery guarantees for (exact and approximate) $3$-designs that parallel the best-known results for $4$-designs. In particular, we derive bounds on the number of measurements sufficient for stable and robust low-rank recovery via nuclear-norm minimization. Our results are especially relevant in practice, as explicit constructions of $4$-designs are significantly more challenging than those of $3$-designs.",

In particular, the Veronese square ($m=2$) corresponds to ternary algebras. We choose five generating operations for the Veronese square of the dendriform operad. We represent the dendriform operad as a suboperad of the Rota-Baxter operad, and express the quadratic relations satisfied by the generating operations as the kernel of a rewriting map.

How densely can a given set of connected components pack in $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ without touching? We answer these two closely related questions for both 4-connected and 8-connected components. In particular, we use structural arguments to upper bound the \"white\" pixel density of infinite images whose white (4- or 8-)connected components have size at most $k$. Explicit tilings show that these bounds are tight for at least half of all natural numbers $k$ in the 4-connected case, and for all $k$ in the 8-connected case. We also extend these results to finite images.\n  To obtain the upper bounds, we define the exterior site perimeter of a connected component and then leverage geometric and topological properties of this set to partition images into nontrivial regions called polygonal tiles. Each polygonal tile contains a single white connected component and satisfies a certain maximality property. We then use isoperimetric inequalities to precisely bound the area of these tiles. The solutions to these problems represent new statistics on the connected component distribution of digital images.",

We employ generalized Taylor-Hood finite elements $\\mathrm{\\mathbf{P}}_{k_u}$-- $\\mathrm{P}_{k_{pr}}$-- $\\mathrm{P}_{k_\u03bb}$, $k_u=k_{pr}+1 \\geq 2$, $k_\u03bb\\geq 1$, for the spatial discretization, where the normal velocity constraint is enforced weakly via a Lagrange multiplier $\u03bb$, and a backward Euler discretization for the time-stepping procedure. Depending on the approximation order of $\u03bb$ and weak formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations, we present stability and error analysis for two different discrete schemes, whose difference lies in the geometric information needed. We establish optimal velocity $L^{2}_{a_h}$-norm error bounds ($a_h$ an energy norm) for both schemes when $k_\u03bb=k_u$, but only for the more information intensive one when $k_\u03bb=k_u-1$, using iso-parametric and super-parametric discretizations, respectively, with the help of a newly derived surface Ritz-Stokes projection. Similarly, stability and optimal convergence for the pressures is established in an $L^2_{L^2}\\times L^2_{H_h^{-1}}$-norm ($H_h^{-1}$ a discrete dual space) when $k_\u03bb=k_u$, using a novel Leray time-projection to ensure weakly divergence conformity for our discrete velocity solution at two different time-steps (surfaces). Assuming further regularity conditions for the more information intensive scheme, along with an almost weak divergence conformity result at two different time-steps, we establish optimal $L^2_{L^2}\\times L^2_{L^2}$-norm pressure error bounds when $k_\u03bb=k_u-1$, using super-parametric approximation.

    "abstract": "This paper establishes the spectral stability of monotone, stationary front solutions for reaction-diffusion equations where the reaction function is of Nagumo (or bistable) type and with diffusion coefficients which are density dependent and degenerate at zero (one of the equilibrium points of the reaction). These stationary profiles connect the non-degenerate equilibrium point with the degenerate state at zero, they are monotone, and arrive to the degenerate state at a finite point. They are neither sharp nor smooth. The degeneracy of the diffusion precludes the application of standard techniques to locate the essential spectrum of the linearized operator around the wave in the energy space $L^2$. This difficulty is overcome with a suitable partition of the spectrum, the analysis of singular sequences, a generalized convergence of operators technique and refined energy estimates. It is shown that the $L^2$-spectrum of the linearized operator around the front is real and with a spectral gap, that is, a positive distance between the imaginary axis and the rest of the spectrum, with the exception of the origin. Moreover, the origin is a simple isolated eigenvalue, associated to the derivative of the profile as eigenfunction (the translation eigenvalue). Finally, it is shown that the linearization generates an analytic semigroup that decays exponentially outside a one-dimensional eigenspace associated to the zero eigenvalue.",
