    "abstract": "We revisit the proof of the de Moivre--Laplace theorem, which is the ancestor of the central limit theorem for the binomial distribution. Our goal is to provide a proof that can be reasonably presented to undergraduate students within a basic course of probability theory. We follow the strategies presented in two classical references, the books of Breiman and Feller, but we replace the arguments involving series expansions of the logarithm or the exponential by the basic inequality $\\exp(t)\\geq 1+t$. This way we avoid completely the use of uniform convergence and power series. We also avoid using Stirling's formula, instead we use the exact formula for the Wallis integral. As a by product of the proof, we also obtain a non-asymptotic inequality linking the binomial and the Gaussian distributions.",

    "title": "A Continuous-Order Integral Operator for Maclaurin-type Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "I introduce a continuous-order analog of the Maclaurin expansion that reconstructs analytic functions. This continuous-order Maclaurin-type operator replaces the discrete sum of integer-order derivatives in the classical Maclaurin expansion with an integral over fractional derivative orders, weighted at the evaluation point by x^r/Gamma(r+1). Numerical experiments on a representative set of analytic functions f show that the uncorrected operator reliably tracks the global shape of f, with a systematic, largely constant offset and an additional deviation localized at the origin. Low-order correction terms, motivated by the classical Euler-Maclaurin summation formula, reduce this discrepancy. With these corrections, the operator reconstructs f accurately in the tested domains. The operator reproduces monomials exactly, reflecting the collapse of derivative information to a single order, as in the classical Maclaurin expansion of monomials. This singular collapse motivates a Taylor-centered extension away from the origin, where the order dependence is predicted to be smooth. Taken together, these results suggest that the continuous-order integration operator, with low-order corrections, provides a coherent framework for generalizing the classical Taylor-Maclaurin expansion.",

The small data hypothesis is assumed to ensure existence of a unique weak solution in the sense of Leray-Hopf.

Based on these exponential convergence rate bounds, we infer exponential bounds for the Kolmogorov $n$-widths of solution sets for analytic forcing and boundary data. This implies corresponding exponential convergence rates of POD Galerkin methods that are based on truth solutions which are obtained offline from low-order, divergence stable mixed Finite Element discretizations.

    "abstract": "We present a latent diffusion-based differentiable inversion method (LD-DIM) for PDE-constrained inverse problems involving high-dimensional spatially distributed coefficients. LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of active nonparametric sequential two-sample testing over multiple heterogeneous data sources. In each time slot, a decision-maker adaptively selects one of $K$ data sources and receives a paired sample generated from that source for testing. The goal is to decide as quickly as possible whether the pairs are generated from the same distribution or not. The gain achieved by such adaptive sampling (in terms of smaller expected stopping time or larger error exponents) has been well-characterized for parametric models via Chernoff's adaptive MLE selection rule [1]. However, analogous results are not known for the case of nonparametric problems, such as two-sample testing, where we place no restrictions on the distributions.\n  Our main contribution is a general active nonparametric testing procedure that combines an adaptive source-selecting strategy within the testing-by-betting framework of [2] that works under minimal distributional assumptions. In each time slot, our scheme proceeds by selecting a source according to a probability that mixes exploitation, favoring sources with the largest empirical distinguishability, and exploration via a vanishing greedy strategy. The (paired) observations so collected are then used to update the \"betting-wealth process\", which is a stochastic process guaranteed to be a nonnegative martingale under the null. The procedure stops and rejects the null when the wealth process exceeds an appropriate threshold; an event that is unlikely under the null. We show that our test controls the type-I error at a prespecified level-$\u03b1$ under the null, and establish its power-one property and a bound on its expected sample size under the alternative. Our results provide a precise characterization of the improvements achievable by a principled adaptive sampling strategy over its passive analog.",

In this paper, design and analysis are cast in a Bayesian framework, where QCD is formulated as an optimal stopping problem with partial observations.

The contributions of the paper are summarized as follows: (i) A Q-learning algorithm is proposed for the general partially observed optimal stopping problem. It is shown to converge under linear function approximation, given suitable assumptions on the basis functions. An example is provided to demonstrate that these assumptions are necessary to ensure algorithmic stability. (ii) Prior theory motivates a particular choice of features in applying Q-learning to QCD. It is shown that, in several scenarios and under ideal conditions, the resulting class of policies contains one that is approximately optimal.

Our algorithm incorporates a momentum-based variance-reduced gradient estimator applied exclusively to the smooth component of the objective, together with carefully designed penalty parameter and dual stepsize updates. Unlike existing approaches that rely on computationally expensive double-loop frameworks, MARS-ADMM operates in a single-loop fashion and requires only a constant number of stochastic gradient evaluations per iteration. Under mild assumptions, we establish that MARS-ADMM achieves an iteration complexity of \\(\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-3})\\), which improves upon the previously best-known bound of \\(\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-3.5})\\) for stochastic Riemannian operator-splitting methods. As a result, our analysis closes the theoretical complexity gap between stochastic Riemannian operator-splitting algorithms and stochastic methods for nonsmooth optimization with nonlinear constraints. Notably, the obtained complexity also matches the best-known bounds in deterministic nonsmooth Riemannian optimization, demonstrating that deterministic-level accuracy can be achieved using only constant-size stochastic samples.",

Our results combine with earlier work to provide a classification of all locally linear involutions on S^4. As a further application, we obtain that strongly negative amphichiral knots with trivial Alexander polynomial are equivariantly topologically slice with respect to the linear action, strengthening a previous result of the first two authors.

To achieve these, a stochastic compensated compactness framework in $L^p$ is developed to overcome the difficulty that the uniform $L^{\\infty}$ bound for the stochastic approximate solutions is unavailable, owing to the stochastic forcing term. The convergence of the vanishing viscosity method is established by employing the stochastic compactness framework, along with careful uniform estimates of the stochastic approximate solutions, to obtain the existence of global martingale entropy solutions with finite relative-energy. In particular, in the polytropic pressure case for all adiabatic exponents, we prove that the global solutions satisfy the local mechanical energy inequality when the initial data are only required to have finite relative-energy (while the higher moment estimates for entropy are not required here, as needed in the earlier work). Higher-order relative energy estimates for approximate solutions are also derived to establish the entropy inequality for more convex entropy pairs and to then prove the compactness of solutions to the stochastic isentropic Euler system. The stochastic compensated compactness framework and the uniform estimate techniques for approximate solutions developed in this paper should be useful in the study of other similar problems.",

Our first result is a localization statement in $K$-theory for the complements of cell closures in smooth cellular varieties. Combining with the Fulton--Lascoux degeneracy loci formula, we prove that $K_0(X_{n,k})$ is canonically isomorphic to $R_{n,k}$, extending classical isomorphisms for the flag variety. We next identify the classes of the Pawlowski--Rhoades varieties with Grothendieck polynomials associated to words $w \\in [k]^n$.

    "abstract": "This work is devoted to the study of representations of finite subgroups of the group of units of quaternion division algebras over a global or local field arising from the inclusion via extension of scalars splitting the algebra. Following a question by Serre, we study the set $\\mathrm{IF}$ of conjugacy classes of integral representations that are conjugates of the given representation over the field. The set $\\mathrm{IF}$ is often called the set of integral forms in the literature. In previous works we have seen that, for a given representation, the set $\\mathrm{IF}$ can be indexed by the vertex set of a suitable subgraph of the Bruhat-Tits tree for the special linear group. In this work, we describe a construction that allows the simultaneous study of the set $\\mathrm{IF}$ over different splitting fields. For this, we devise and use a theory of twisted Galois form of Bruhat-Tits trees. With this tool, we explicitly compute, in most cases, the cardinality of $\\mathrm{IF}$ for the representation of the classical quaternion group of order $8$ studied by Serre, Feit and others, as much as for other similar groups.",

For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.",

Derived from Onsager's variational principle, this thermodynamically consistent diffuse-interface model incorporates both the chemotaxis effects induced by the chemical species and the mass transport processes within the mixture. For the two-dimensional initial-boundary value problem, we establish the existence of global finite energy solutions and global weak solutions, using a suitable approximation scheme combined with compactness methods. Next, by carefully analyzing three decoupled subsystems and employing a bootstrap argument, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution for sufficiently regular initial data, as well as the propagation of regularity for global weak solutions. In particular, we show that the density of the chemical substance stays bounded for all time if its initial datum is bounded. This implies a significant distinction from the classical Keller--Segel system: diffusion driven by the chemical potential gradient can prevent the formation of concentration singularities.",

The theorem is motivated by recent conjectures and their proof strategy by Gao and Zhang on the Northcott property of the Beilinson--Bloch height pairing. Our method involves a homological algebra interpretation of the Archimedean height by Hain. This interpretation allows us to introduce motivic viewpoints using Deligne cohomology, cycle class maps and higher Chow groups.\n  Especially, we compare the biextension by Hain and Brosnan--Pearlstein over $\\mathbb{C}$ based on Poincar\u00e9 line bundle and Hodge theory with the $\\mathbb{G}_{\\mathrm{m}}$-biextension of Bloch and Seibold defined by two families of homologically trivial cycles on a generically smooth family of projective varieties over a smooth curve. Our comparison, a relative version of the work of Gorchinskiy, enhances his derived viewpoint on these biextensions. Especially when the family of varieties are smooth, the two constructions are related via derived regulator maps to Deligne cohomology, reinterpreted similarly to Beilinson's absolute Hodge cohomology, as well as the derived description of Hardouin's biextension that generalizes Poincar\u00e9 line bundle by Hain. The comparison when the family defined over a smooth curve has a strongly semistable reduction further involves a simple monodromy computation using mixed Hodge modules.\n  Along our discussion, we simplify the discussion of Bloch and Seibold, partly in the style of Gorchinskiy. For example, the symmetry of their biextension is proved more easily than their work.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class exhibit remarkable fluctuation phenomena. While a variety of powerful methods have led to a detailed understanding of their typical fluctuations or large deviations, much less is known about behavior on intermediate, or moderate deviation, scales. Addressing this problem requires refined asymptotic control of the integrable structures underlying KPZ models.\n  Motivated by this perspective, we study multiplicative statistics of discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles (dOPEs) in different scaling regimes, with a particular focus on applications to tail probabilities of the height function in the stochastic six-vertex model. For a large class of dOPEs, we obtain robust singular asymptotic estimates for multiplicative statistics critically scaled near a saturated-to-band transition. These asymptotics exhibit universal crossover behavior, interpolating between Airy, Painlev\u00e9 XXXIV, and Bessel-type regimes. Our proofs employ the Riemann-Hilbert Problem (RHP) approach to obtain asymptotics for the correlation kernel of a deformed version of the dOPE across the critical scaling windows. These asymptotics are then used on a double integral formula relating this kernel to partition function ratios, which may be of independent interest. At the technical level, the RHP analysis requires a novel parameter-dependent local parametrix, which needs a separate asymptotic analysis of its own.\n  Using these results, together with a known identity relating a Laplace-type transform of the stochastic six-vertex model height function to a multiplicative statistic of the Meixner point process, we derive moderate deviation estimates for the height function in both the upper and lower tail regimes, with sharp exponents and constants.",

This article introduces a decomposition method that enables a distributed solution to OPF problems. The proposed method solves OPF problems with a sensitivity-based formulation using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We also propose a distributed method to compute system-wide sensitivities without sharing local parameters. This approach facilitates scalable optimization while satisfying global constraints and limiting data sharing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using a large set of test systems and compare its performance against existing decomposition methods.

The core idea is to exploit encoded pilots (EP), enabling the use of both pilot and parity bits to iteratively refine channel estimates. To further improve performance, an iterative channel tracking (ICT) method is proposed that takes advantage of the temporal correlation of the channel. An analytical evaluation of the proposed estimator is provided in terms of normalized mean-squared error (NMSE), along with a study of its computational complexity and the impact of the code rate.

    "abstract": "We develop polynomial-time algorithms for near-optimal minimax mean estimation under $\\ell_2$-squared loss in a Gaussian sequence model under convex constraints. The parameter space is an origin-symmetric, type-2 convex body $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, and we assume additional regularity conditions: specifically, we assume $K$ is well-balanced, i.e., there exist known radii $r, R > 0$ such that $r B_2 \\subseteq K \\subseteq R B_2$, as well as oracle access to the Minkowski gauge of $K$. Under these and some further assumptions on $K$, our procedures achieve the minimax rate up to small factors, depending poly-logarithmically on the dimension, while remaining computationally efficient.\n  We further extend our methodology to the linear regression and robust heavy-tailed settings, establishing polynomial-time near-optimal estimators when the constraint set satisfies the regularity conditions above. To the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first general framework for attaining statistically near-optimal performance under such broad geometric constraints while preserving computational tractability.",

    "abstract": "A graph is color-critical if it contains an edge whose deletion reduces its chromatic number. This class of graphs, including cliques and odd cycles, plays a central role in extremal graph theory. In this paper, following an influential line of research initiated by Bollob\u00e1s-Nikiforov, we study the spectral supersaturation problem for color-critical graphs. Let $T_{n,r}$ be the $r$-partite Tur\u00e1n graph, let $\\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}$ denote the family of graphs obtained from $T_{n,r}$ by adding $q$ edges, and let $\u03bb(G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$. We first prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with chromatic number $r+1$, there exists $\u03b4_F > 0$ such that for sufficiently large $n$ and all $1 \\leq q \\leq \u03b4_F \\sqrt{n}$, any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\u03bb(G) \\ge \\min_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}} \u03bb(T)$ contains at least $q \\cdot c(n,F)$ copies of $F$, where $c(n,F)$ denotes the minimum number of copies of $F$ created by adding a single edge to $T_{n,r}$; moreover, any extremal graph $G$ must belong to $ \\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}$.Next, we prove a spectral supersaturation result for the analogous condition $\u03bb(G) \\ge \\max_{T \\in \\mathcal{T}_{n,r,q}} \u03bb(T)$, valid for all $1 \\leq q \\leq \u03b4_F n$. Together, these results provide a complete resolution to a problem proposed by Ning-Zhai, and establish a spectral counterpart to the well-known results of Mubayi and Pikhurko-Yilma in the extremal supersaturation setting. A notable feature of our first result is that the restriction $q = O(\\sqrt{n})$ is tight up to a constant factor, in contrast to the linear bounds provided by other settings discussed above. As applications, we extend a result of Liu-Mubayi, and solve a related conjecture by Li-Lu-Peng.",

We analyze in detail the case of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle, comparing classical $L^2$ geometries associated with finite Radon measures and Sobolev-type regularizations via Fourier methods.

We prove that these satisfy appropriate wall-crossing formulas using the non-abelian localization theorem.

A $q$-ary constant-weight code, as a nonempty subset of $\\mathcal{H}_{q}(n,w)$, has always been a fundamental topic in coding theory. This paper investigates the tiling problem of $\\mathcal{H}_{q}(n,w)$ with optimal $(n,d,w)_{q}$-codes, simply denoted by $\\mathrm{TOC}_{q}(n,d,w)$, meaning a partition of $\\mathcal{H}_{q}(n,w)$ into mutually disjoint optimal $q$-ary constant-weight codes with distance $d$. When the distance $d$ is odd, we investigate large sets of generalized Steiner systems. When $d$ is even, we define large sets of generalized maximum H-packings. We present several general construction approaches for generating $\\mathrm{TOC}_{q}(n,d,w)$s via $t$-resolvable Steiner systems and almost-regular edge-colorings of complete hypergraphs. For the cases $d=2$ and $d=2w$, we completely resolve the existence problem of $\\mathrm{TOC}_{q}(n,d,w)$s for all parameters $q,n$ and $w$. Particularly, we pay attention to tilings for weight three. For binary case and weight three, the existence problem of $\\mathrm{TOC}_{2}(n,d,3)$s is totally resolved. For specific alphabet size $q\\ge 3$, we obtain many infinite families of $\\mathrm{TOC}_{q}(n,d,3)$s for distances $d=3,4,5$.",

The best known bounds show that the support size of the capacity-achieving distribution is lower-bounded by a term of order $A$ and upper-bounded by a term of order $A^2$, where $A$ denotes the amplitude constraint. It was conjectured in [1] that the linear scaling is optimal. In this work, we establish a new lower bound of order $A\\sqrt{\\log A}$, improving the known bound and ruling out the conjectured linear scaling.\n  To obtain this result, we quantify the fact that the capacity-achieving output distribution is close to the uniform distribution in the interior of the amplitude constraint. Next, we introduce a wrapping operation that maps the problem to a compact domain and develop a theory of best approximation of the uniform distribution by finite Gaussian mixtures.

While operations research has traditionally developed solver-centric methods emphasizing model structure and optimality, recent advances in machine learning are reshaping scheduling into a data-centric discipline that learns from experience and adapts to dynamic environments. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative review of this methodological transition. We first revisit classical optimization-based approaches and summarize how ML has been integrated within them to improve computational efficiency. We then review end-to-end learning approaches that generate scheduling solutions directly from data, highlighting how they shift decision-making from explicit optimization to learned inference. Adopting a systematic, method-oriented perspective, we compare these paradigms and their underlying learning algorithms in terms of principles, scalability, interpretability, and generalization. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and outline future directions along three interdependent dimensions, scalability, reliability, and universality, that together define a pathway toward adaptive, intelligent, and trustworthy scheduling systems for data-driven operations management.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the key technologies capable of simultaneously improving communication and sensing services in future wireless networks. Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Although the gains of MA-enabled ISAC systems are relatively well studied in the far field, they remain almost unexplored in near-field scenarios. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimum sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms that optimize the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer, the sensing receive combiner, the positions of the users' MAs and the positions of the base station (BS) transmit MAs in an alternating manner for the considered ISAC system, for the cases where linear procoding and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding are employed at the BS. Simulation results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems equipped with fixed antennas only. We show that the scheme with linear precoding achieves larger WSR for unequal users' weight rates, while the scheme with ZF precoding maintains an approximately constant WSR for all users' weight rates. Additionally, we demonstrate that the WSRs of the proposed schemes are highly dependent on the inter-antenna interference between different user's MAs, and that the sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the communication performance.",

In this work, we compare RIS, active RIS, and RDARS in terms of coverage and energy efficiency (EE) in both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands, and we investigate the impact of placement and the number of elements of reconfigurable surface (RS) on EE and coverage. The simulation results show that RDARS offers a highly energy-efficient alternative of enhancing coverage in sub-6GHz systems, while active RIS is significantly more energy-efficient in mmWave systems. Additionally, for a lower number of RS elements and for near UEs, RIS remains considerably more energy-efficient than both active RIS and RDARS.",

This invariant turns out to be equivalent to an infinite cyclic version of the Carter-Silver-Williams (CSW) polynomial. The importance of the CSW polynomial is that half its symplectic rank gives strong lower bounds on the virtual genus. Recall that the virtual genus of a virtual link $J$ is the smallest genus of all closed orientable surfaces $\u03a3$ on which $J$ can be represented by a link diagram on $\u03a3$. Here we generalize the CSW lower bound to all quantum supergroups $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ with $m,n>0$. For $(m,n)=(1,1)$, the $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ bound is the same as the CSW bound. However, changing the value of the pair $(m,n)$ can give lower bounds better than those available from other known methods. We compare the $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ lower bounds to those coming from the CSW polynomial, the surface bracket, the arrow polynomial, hyperbolicity, and the Gordon-Litherland determinant test. As a first application, we show that the Seifert genus of homologically trivial knots in thickened surfaces is not additive under the connected sum operation of virtual knots. As a second application, we prove that the Jaeger-Kauffman-Saleur invariant of a virtual knot is always realizable as the Alexander polynomial of an infinite cyclic cover of a knot complement in some $\u03a3\\times [0,1]$, but is not always so on a surface of minimal genus. This is accomplished with a generalization of the $Zh$-construction, called the homotopy $Zh$-construction.",

In this study, we analyse the kinematic properties of the null curve using the null natural Frenet frame $% \\{x,\u03be,N,W\\}$. We then investigate the bending, torsion, and other geometric invariants of Smarandache curves constructed as linear combinations of these frame vectors (i.e., combinations of tangent, normal, or binormal vectors). The findings reveal how the original properties of the null curve are transferred to the Smarandache curves and how the metric of this particular space affects the characteristics of the Smarandache curves.

It is coffered with an array of approximately square sunken lacunaria, whose sizes and positions vary so as to accommodate the constraints of the curved surface and its boundaries. A similar design appears in the dome of the Roman Pantheon. Using methods of differential geometry, we hypothesise that these cofferings should be the images under conformal mappings of regular square tilings of a rectangle or finite cylinder. This guarantees that the coffer ribs meet exactly at right angles and the coffers are close to being square. These mappings are simply the inverse of Mercator's projection of the curved surface onto a plane. For a ceiling which is a general surface of revolution, we derive formulae for the dimensions and location of each coffer. Our results, taking into account camera distortion, are in excellent agreement with photographs of the Hawksmoor ceiling and the Pantheon dome, as well as with recent direct measurements of the latter. We also describe a protocol by which Hawksmoor's ceiling might have been constructed without advanced mathematics.",

We demonstrate that the conformable derivative is not a fractional operator but a useful computational tool for systems with power-law time scaling, equivalent to classical differentiation under a nonlinear time reparametrization. Several results presented in the literature as novel fractional contributions can be reinterpreted within a classical framework. We show that problems formulated using the conformable derivative can be transformed into classical formulations via a change of variable. The solution is derived classically and then transformed back, this reformulation highlights the absence of genuinely nonlocal fractional effects. We provide a theoretical analysis, numerical simulations comparing conformable, classical, and truly fractional (Caputo) models, and discuss the reasons why this misconception persists. Our results suggest that classical derivatives, as well as established fractional derivatives, offer a more faithful framework for modeling memory-dependent phenomena.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a multi-population mean field game framework to examine how economic status and authority perception shape vaccination and social distancing decisions under different epidemic control policies. We carried out a survey to inform our model and stratify the population into six groups based on income and perception of authority, capturing behavioral heterogeneity. Individuals adjust their socialization and vaccination levels to optimize objectives such as minimizing treatment costs, complying with social-distancing guidelines if they are authority-followers, or reducing losses from decreased social interactions if they are authority-indifferents, alongside economic costs. Public health authorities influence behavior through social-distancing guidelines and vaccination costs. We characterize the Nash equilibrium via a forward-backward differential equation system, provide its mathematical analysis, and develop a numerical algorithm to solve it. Our findings reveal a trade-off between social-distancing and vaccination decisions. Under stricter guidelines that target both susceptible and infected individuals, followers reduce both socialization and vaccination levels, while indifferents increase socialization due to followers' preventative measures. Adaptive guidelines targeting infected individuals effectively reduce infections and narrow the gap between low- and high-income groups, even when susceptible individuals socialize more and vaccinate less. Lower vaccination costs incentivize vaccination among low-income groups, but their impact on disease spread is smaller than when they are coupled with social-distancing guidelines. Trust-building emerges as a critical factor in epidemic mitigation, underscoring the importance of data-informed, game-theoretical models that aim to understand complex human responses to mitigation policies.",

This framework effectively balances strong sparsity promotion with solution stability, and is particularly suitable for high-dimensional variable selection involving highly correlated features. Built upon a difference-of-convex (DC) structure, DCEN employs two continuously tunable parameters to unify classical and state-of-the-art models--including Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge, and $\\ell_1-\u03b1\\ell_2$--as special cases. Theoretically, sufficient conditions for exact and stable recovery are established under the restricted isometry property (RIP), and a closed-form expression of the DCEN regularization proximal operator is derived. Moreover, two efficient optimization algorithms are developed based on the DC algorithm (DCA) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Within the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) framework, the global convergence of DCA and its linear convergence rate are rigorously established. Furthermore, DCEN is extended to image reconstruction by incorporating total variation (TV) regularization, yielding the DCEN-TV model, which is efficiently solved via the Split Bregman method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DCEN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in sparse signal recovery, high-dimensional variable selection under strong collinearity, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image reconstruction, achieving superior recovery accuracy and robustness.",

Introducing a negative cost correlation proves particularly beneficial in both scenarios: it increases the likelihood of the agent performing at least once under low budgets and balances the agent's total costs to facilitate consistent performance under high budgets.

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a class of stable and convergent numerical methods for the approximate solution of the viscoelastic Giesekus model in two space dimensions. The model couples the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with an evolution equation for an additional stress tensor accounting for elastic effects. This coupled evolution equation is stated here in terms of the elastic deformation gradient and models transport and nonlinear relaxation effects. In the existing literature, numerical schemes for such models often suffer from accuracy limitations and convergence problems, usually due to the lack of rigorous existence results or inherent limitations of the discretization. Therefore, our main goal is to prove the (subsequence) convergence of the proposed numerical method to a large-data global weak solution in two dimensions, without relying on cut-offs or additional regularization. This also provides an alternative proof of the recent existence result by Bul\u00ed\u010dek et al.~(Nonlinearity, 2022). Finally, we verify the practicality of the proposed method through numerical experiments, including convergence studies and typical benchmark problems.",

    "abstract": "High-gain beamforming (BF) is essential for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications to overcome severe path loss, but this requires acquiring precise satellite positions. Conventional satellite acquisition typically relies on time-domain beam sweeping, which incurs substantial overhead and latency. In this correspondence, we propose an efficient one-shot satellite acquisition framework that capitalizes on two phenomena traditionally regarded as impairments: i) Doppler effects and ii) beam-squint effects. Specifically, we derive a closed-form \\emph{rainbow beamformer} that leverages beam-squint effects to align frequency-dependent beam directions with satellite positions inferred from their Doppler shifts. This approach enables reception from multiple satellites at once without requiring beam sweeping. To extract satellite position information, we develop three Doppler-aware angle estimation algorithms based on received signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional beam sweeping approaches in both acquisition accuracy and required time slots. These gains stem from the ability of the proposed rainbow BF to exploit the \\emph{angle-dependent nature of Doppler shifts}, enabling full angular-domain coverage with a single pilot transmission and reception.",

It has further geometric consequences, related to the braid index, the existence of minimal string Bennequin surfaces for banded and Whitehead doubled links, the Bennequin sharpness problem, and the equivalence of their quasipositivity and strong quasipositivity.

A unified theooretical framework is developed that unique determines both the anomaly's geometry and discontinuous coefficients characterizing the altered interactions within the degraded region. Our results cover smooth anomalies in time-dependent systems and are extended to non-smooth polyhedral inclusions in stationary regimes.

Viewing covering as a form of quantization in general metric spaces, we introduce the notion of the average covering radius as a natural measure of average distortion, complementing the classical worst-case covering radius. By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.\n  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime. Together, these results provide new insights into the role of algebraic structure in covering problems and high-dimensional quantization.",

Recently, Reiner and Zotova proved a Hilton--Milner type stability result showing that for large $p$, any sum-free set not contained in the extremal cuboid has size at most $\\frac{p-2}{3} p^{n-1}$, and all possible structures attaining this bound were classified.\n  In this paper, we develop a general Hilton--Milner theory for $(k,\\ell)$-sum-free sets in $\\mathbb{F}_p^n$ for $k > \\ell \\ge 1$. We determine the maximum size of such sets for all $p \\equiv \u03bc\\pmod{k+\\ell}$ with $2 \\le \u03bc\\le k+\\ell-1$, and show that the extremal configurations are precisely $\\lceil (\u03bc-1)/2 \\rceil$ non-isomorphic cuboids.

In particular, when $2 \\le \u03bc\\le k+\\ell-3$ (which is tight), only two structural types occur for all $k+\\ell \\ge 5$; and when $\u03bc= 2$ or $3$, we obtain a complete classification for all $k > \\ell \\ge 1$.\n  Our arguments combine additive combinatorics and Fourier-analytic methods, and make use of recent progress toward the long-standing $3k-4$ conjecture, highlighting new connections between inverse additive number theory and extremal problems over finite vector spaces.",

This kind of phenomenon was earlier observed in the non-rotational case $\u03a9= 0$ in Carles' work.

Using the classification of Mati\u0107 and an explicit analysis of Jacquet modules, we describe these duals in terms of precise inducing data. Our results extend known descriptions for classical groups to the metaplectic groups case and clarify the role of Aubert duality for non-linear covering groups, providing a foundation for future applications to the study of unitary representations for those cases. Furthermore, We are able to show that the same method applies to odd general spin groups $GSpin(2n+1)$, yielding an explicit description of Aubert duals in that setting as well.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a structure-preserving method for the stabilization of linear port-Hamiltonian (pH) descriptor systems via output feedback. The stabilization problem is NP-hard for general descriptor systems. Existing approaches often rely on explicit knowledge of the structure-defining matrix $Q$, which is difficult to determine in practice. When $Q$ is unknown, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which proportional output feedback ensures that the closed-loop system is regular, impulse-free, asymptotically stable, and retains the port-Hamiltonian structure. These conditions also allow any positive definite matrix to serve as the feedback matrix. The framework is further extended to proportional and derivative output feedback, enabling the assignment of a desired dynamical order. The proposed method thus generalizes existing stabilization results from the special case $Q = I$ to systems with an unknown $Q$, offering a systematic method to structure-preserving stabilization of pH descriptor systems.",

    "title": "Clipped Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: A Refined Analysis",
    "abstract": "Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\\frak p}$-th moment where ${\\frak p}\\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $\u03c3_{\\frak l}^{\\frak p}$ for some $\u03c3_{\\frak l}\\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\\cal O}(\u03c3_{\\frak l}\\ln(1/\u03b4)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\\cal O}(\u03c3_{\\frak l}^2\\ln^2(1/\u03b4)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $\u03b4\\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\\cal O}(\u03c3_{\\frak l}d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/2{\\frak p}}\\ln^{1-1/{\\frak p}}(1/\u03b4)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ and ${\\cal O}(\u03c3_{\\frak l}^2d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/{\\frak p}}\\ln^{2-2/{\\frak p}}(1/\u03b4)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\\rm eff}\\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation.",

    "abstract": "We consider the strongly NP-hard single-machine coupled task scheduling problem with exact delays to minimize the makespan. In this problem, a set of jobs has to be scheduled, each composed of two tasks interspersed by an exact delay. Given that no preemption is allowed, the goal consists of minimizing the completion time of the last scheduled task. We model the problem using constraint programming (CP) and propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our CP model applies well-established global constraints. Our BRKGA combines some successful components in the literature: an initial solution generator, periodical restarts and shakes, and a local search algorithm. Furthermore, the BRKGA's decoder is focused on efficiency rather than optimality, which accelerates the solution space exploration. Computational experiments on a benchmark set containing instances with up to 100 jobs (200 tasks) indicate that the proposed BRKGA can efficiently explore the problem solution space, providing high-quality approximate solutions within low computational times. It can also provide better solutions than the CP model under the same computational settings, i.e., three minutes of time limit and a single thread. The CP model, when offered a longer running time of 3600 seconds and multiple threads, significantly improved the results, reaching the current best-known solution for 90.56% of these instances. Finally, our experiments highlight the importance of the shake and local search components in the BRKGA, whose combination significantly improves the results of a standard BRKGA.",

    "abstract": "This is the second in a series of papers that aim to develop rigorous and most encompassing foundations for field theory, where in the first installment, we laid out the natural formulation of bosonic variational field theory via the functorial geometry of smooth sets. Here, we extend this to the category ThickenedSmoothSets of infinitesimally thickened smooth sets. We first describe the Cahiers topos in a simplified, but fully rigorous, $\\mathbb{R}$-algebraic setting -- which should serve as a more accessible introduction to the theory of Synthetic Differential Geometry to both physicists and mathematicians. Then, we formulate local Lagrangian field theory in this rigorous setting in which infinitesimal spaces exist and interact correctly with the field-theoretic spaces of infinite jet bundles, off-shell and on-shell spaces of fields etc.\n  This setting subsumes all previous constructions and further recovers all the relevant tangent bundles of traditional (off-shell and on-shell) field theory considerations via the synthetic tangent bundle construction, i.e., as ``infinitesimal curves'' in those spaces, which were previously defined only in an ad-hoc manner. Beyond finally establishing a firm foundation for such aspects of the theory, this approach recognizes the variational principle of local Lagrangian field theory, equivalently, as the intersection of thickened smooth sets. It also suggests the rigorous formalization of perturbative field theory as the restriction to a (synthetic) infinitesimal neighborhood around a field configuration. Furthermore, our context naturally accommodates more general, rigorous considerations, in which the manifolds may have boundaries and corners, a situation that has recently been attracting greater attention in the field-theoretical literature.",

For a non-negative integer $k$, a graph $G$ is said to be proper conflict-free (degree+$k$)-choosable if given any list assignment $L$ for $G$ where $|L(v)| = d(v) + k$ holds for every vertex $v \\in V(G)$, there exists a proper conflict-free coloring $\u03c6$ of $G$ such that $\u03c6(v) \\in L(v)$ for all $v \\in V(G)$. Recently, Kashima, \u0160krekovski, and Xu proposed two related conjectures on proper conflict-free choosability: the first asserts the existence of an absolute constant $k$ such that every graph is proper conflict-free (degree+$k$)-choosable, while the second strengthens this claim by restricting to connected graphs other than the cycle of length 5 and reducing the constant to $k=2$. In this paper, we confirm the second conjecture for three graph classes: $K_4$-minor-free graphs with maximum degree at most 4, outer-1-planar graphs with maximum degree at most 4, and planar graphs with girth at least 12; we also confirm the first conjecture for these same graph classes, in addition to all outer-1-planar graphs (without degree constraints). Moreover, we prove that planar graphs with girth at least 12 and outer-1-planar graphs are proper conflict-free $6$-choosable.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining high-precision guaranteed lower eigenvalue bounds remains difficult, even though the standard high-order conforming finite element (FEM) easily yields extremely sharp upper bounds. Recently developed rigorous approaches using such as Crouzeix--Raviart or linear conforming elements do not extend well to high-order FEM. Some non-standard FEM approaches can provide sharp eigenvalue bounds but are technically involved. This persistent gap between accurate upper bounds and equally sharp rigorous lower bounds via standard high-order conforming FEMs makes the problem technically demanding and highly competitive. In this paper, we propose a new two-stage rigorous algorithm that closes this gap by employing high-order FEM on graded meshes and producing rigorous lower eigenvalue bounds as sharp as the corresponding high-order upper bounds, as demonstrated in our numerical examples. Numerical experiments for the Laplacian and Steklov eigenvalue problems on square and dumbbell domains show the accuracy and efficiency of the method, particularly on graded or highly nonuniform meshes. These results confirm that the proposed approach provides a practical and competitive solution to the long-standing difficulty of obtaining sharp, reliable lower eigenvalue bounds.",

Grapheurs are well-suited to modeling hubs and connections between them in large graphs; previous notions of graph limits based on subgraph densities fail to adequately model such global structures as subgraphs are inherently local. Using our framework, we present an edge-based sampling approach for testing properties pertaining to hubs in large graphs. This method relies on an edge-based analog of the Szemer\u00e9di regularity lemma, whereby we show that sampling a small number of edges from a large graph approximately preserves its quotients.

As the primary results of this paper, we validate this new structure. We prove that the simplicial set induced by our 3-crossed module forms a quasi-category. Furthermore, we show that the Moore complex of length 3 associated with a simplicial group naturally admits the structure of our 3-crossed module.

In our previous work \\cite{CFS}, we analyzed the case of a completely wetted crystal and described how the interplay between surfactant evaporation and mass conservation leads to a transition between crystalline mean curvature flow and pinned evolutions. In the present paper, we extend the analysis to the regime of partial wetting, where the surfactant occupies only a portion of the interface. Within the minimizing-movements scheme, we rigorously derive the continuum evolution and show how partial wetting introduces a complex coupling between interfacial motion and redistribution of surfactant. The resulting evolution exhibits new features absent in the fully wetted case, including the coexistence of moving and pinned facets or the emergence and long-lived metastable states. This provides, to our knowledge, the first discrete-to-continuum variational description of partially wetted crystalline interfaces, bridging the gap between microscopic lattice models and experimentally observed surfactant-induced pinning phenomena in immiscible systems.",

Over the past years, various generalizations of this distribution have been proposed by different authors. The generalized Lindley distributions sometimes have many parameters, and although they show good flexibility, their statistical form becomes complicated. In this article, we propose a new and simple distribution determined by the recursive relation of the Lindley distribution and the Gamma distribution with specific weights. Subsequently, some statistical properties of this distribution are examined, and with real numerical examples, its superiority over the Lindley generalizations is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a natively positive approximation method based on the Feynman-Kac representation using random walks, to approximate the solution to the one-dimensional parabolic Anderson model of Skorokhod type, with either a flat or a Dirac delta initial condition. Assuming the driving noise is a fractional Brownian sheet with Hurst parameters $H \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ and $H_* \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ in time and space, respectively, we also provide an error analysis of the proposed method. The error in $L^p (\u03a9)$ norm is of order \\[ O \\big(h^{\\frac{1}{2}[(2H + H_* - 1) \\wedge 1] - \u03b5}\\big), \\] where $h > 0$ is the step size in time (resp. $\\sqrt{h}$ in space), and $\u03b5> 0$ can be chosen arbitrarily small. This error order matches the H\u00f6lder continuity of the solution in time with a correction order $\u03b5$, making it `almost' optimal. Furthermore, these results provide a quantitative framework for convergence of the partition function of directed polymers in Gaussian environments to the parabolic Anderson model.",

    "abstract": "For learned models to be trustworthy, it is essential to verify their robustness to perturbations in the training data. Classical approaches involve uncertainty quantification via confidence intervals and bootstrap methods. In contrast, recent work proposes a more stringent form of robustness: stability to the removal of any subset of $k$ samples from the training set. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of this criterion for ordinary least squares (OLS). Our contributions are as follows: (1) Given $n$ i.i.d. training samples from a general misspecified model, we prove that with high probability, OLS is robust to the removal of any $k \\ll n $ samples. (2) For data of dimension $p$, OLS can withstand up to ${k\\ll \\sqrt{np}/\\log n}$ sample removals while remaining robust and achieving the same error rate as OLS applied to the full dataset. Conversely, if $k$ is proportional to $n$, OLS is provably non-robust. (3) We revisit prior analyses that found several econometric datasets to be highly non-robust to sample removals. While this appears to contradict our results in (1), we demonstrate that the sensitivity is due to either heavy-tailed responses or correlated samples. Empirically, this sensitivity is considerably attenuated by classical robust methods, such as linear regression with a Huber loss.",

    "title": "Bayesian Effective Dimension: A Mutual Information Perspective",
    "abstract": "High-dimensional Bayesian procedures often exhibit behavior that is effectively low dimensional, even when the ambient parameter space is large or infinite-dimensional. This phenomenon underlies the success of shrinkage priors, regularization, and approximate Bayesian methods, yet it is typically described only informally through notions such as sparsity, intrinsic dimension, or degrees of freedom. In this paper we introduce the \\emph{Bayesian effective dimension}, a model- and prior-dependent quantity defined through the mutual information between parameters and data. This notion quantifies the expected information gain from prior to posterior and provides a coordinate-free measure of how many directions in parameter space are statistically learnable at a given sample size. In regular parametric models the effective dimension coincides with the usual parameter dimension, while in high-dimensional, ill-posed, or strongly regularized settings it can be substantially smaller. We develop basic properties of the effective dimension and present explicit calculations for Gaussian location models and linear models with general design, revealing close connections with spectral complexity and effective rank. These examples illustrate how shrinkage and regularization mechanisms directly control the growth of effective dimension. The framework offers a unifying perspective on dimension reduction in Bayesian inference and provides insight into uncertainty quantification and the behavior of approximate posterior distributions.",

We propose a generalized LMMSE-based uplink channel estimation scheme that dynamically activates FA ports during pilot transmission, efficiently exploiting antenna reconfigurability under practical training constraints. Building on this, we design a distributed port selection strategy that minimizes per-AP channel estimation error by exploiting spatial correlation among FA ports. We systematically analyze the impact of antenna geometry and spatial correlation using the Jakes' channel model for different AP array configurations, including uniform linear and planar arrays. We then derive SINR expressions for centralized and distributed uplink processing and obtain a closed-form uplink SE expression for centralized maximum-ratio combining using the use-and-then-forget bound. Finally, we propose an alternating-optimization framework to select FA port configurations that maximize the uplink sum SE. Numerical results show that the proposed FA-aware channel estimation and port optimization strategies greatly reduce channel estimation error and significantly improve sum-SE over fixed-antenna and non-optimized FA baselines, confirming FAs as a key enabler for scalable, adaptive CF-mMIMO networks.",

Starting from a cell-level model describing the electric potential and the degree of porosity, we perform dimension analysis to identify a relevant scaling in terms of a small parameter $\\ve$ - the ratio between the cell and the tissue size. The electric potential satisfies electrostatic equations in the extra- and intracellular domains, while its jump across the cell membrane evolves according to a nonlinear law coupled with an ordinary differential equation for the porosity degree. We prove the well-posedness of the microscopic problem, derive a priori estimates, obtain formal asymptotics, and rigorously justify the expansion combining two-scale convergence with monotonicity arguments. The resulting macroscopic model exhibits memory effects and a nonlinear, time-dependent effective current. It captures the nontrivial evolution of effective conductivity, including a characteristic drop reflecting the capacitive behavior of the lipid bilayer, in agreement with experimental data. Numerical computations of the effective conductivity confirm that, although microscopic conductivity is constant, tissue conductivity varies nonlinearly with electric field strength, showing a sigmoid trend. This suggests a rigorous mathematical explanation for experimentally observed conductivity dynamics.",

This work investigates risk-averse online optimization in dynamic environments with varying risk levels, employing Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. To capture the dynamics of the environment and risk levels, we employ the function variation metric and introduce a novel risk-level variation metric. Two information settings are considered: a first-order scenario, where the learner observes both function values and their gradients; and a zeroth-order scenario, where only function evaluations are available. For both cases, we develop risk-averse learning algorithms with a limited sampling budget and analyze their dynamic regret bounds in terms of function variation, risk-level variation, and the total number of samples. The regret analysis demonstrates the adaptability of the algorithms in non-stationary and risk-sensitive settings. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the methods.",

This class includes the anti-ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss model, the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on expander graphs, and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with disorder of negative mean. Existing approaches to rapid mixing rely crucially on log-concavity or spectral width bounds and therefore can break down in the presence of a negative outlier.\n  To address this difficulty, we develop a new covariance approximation method based on Gaussian approximation. This method is implemented via an iterative application of Stein's method to quadratic tilts of sums of bounded random variables, which may be of independent interest. The resulting analysis provides an operator-norm control of the full correlation structure under arbitrary external fields. Combined with the localization schemes of Eldan and Chen, these estimates lead to a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and near-optimal mixing time bounds in regimes where spectral width bounds fail. As a complementary result, we prove exponential lower bounds on the mixing time for low temperature anti-ferromagnetic Ising models on sparse Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi graphs, based on the existence of gapped states as in the recent work of Sellke.",

A finite collection of convex bodies in Euclidean $d$-space is called a non-separable family (or NS-family) if every hyperplane intersecting their convex hull also intersects at least one member of the family. Recent work has focused on minimal coverings of NS-families consisting of positive homothetic convex bodies. In this paper, we strengthen these results by establishing their analogues for weakly non-separable families of convex polytopes. We further obtain stability results and analyze maximal weakly non-separable families of cubes.

We classify the centrality and commutativity of these skew-polynomial algebras depending on the Lie type and the order of $\u03b6$ modulo 8. We describe Hopf ideals in the quantum group induced from ideals in these subalgebras, including the non-commutative cases.\n  Among these, we construct and analyze a family of Hopf ideals that depend on the choice of an element in the Weyl group. We show that they arise naturally both in the construction of (partial) $R$-matrices and as vanishing ideals of Bruhat subgroups. Specialization to the maximal element yields a rigorous construction of restricted quantum groups as pre-triangular Hopf algebras, independent of any choices.\n  Our treatment also includes even orders of $\u03b6$, non-simply laced Lie types, and minimal ground rings. Consequently, we extend some results of De Concini-Kac-Procesi, whose work focuses on odd orders of $\u03b6$, which forces the subalgebra to be strictly central, and complex ground fields. This includes the identification of the subalgebras for Lie types $\\mathsf{A}_n$ and $\\mathsf{B}_2$ with the coordinate rings of associated algebraic groups in the commutative cases, even if $\u03b6$ has even order. Our descriptions are computationally explicit and do not utilize Poisson structures.\n  As technical preparations, we discuss PBW bases over minimal rings, dependencies on choices of convex orderings, as well as various new constructions of, and relations among, automorphisms on quantum groups. The latter include formulae for the Garside element in the Lustzig-Artin group action and the family of Che-transformations.",

The controls depend only on time and act through a prescribed family of spatial profiles. Our first result establishes the small-time global approximate controllability of the system using three scalar controls, between states that share the same sign. This property is obtained by adapting the geometric control approach to the fourth-order setting, using a finite family of frequency-localized controls. We then study the small-time global exact controllability to non-zero constant states for the concerned system. This second result is achieved by analyzing the null controllability of an appropriate linearized fourth-order system and by deducing the controllability of the nonlinear bilinear model through a fixed-point argument together with the small-time global approximate control property.",

    "abstract": "Gauss--Christoffel quadrature is a fundamental method for numerical integration, and its convergence analysis is closely related to the decay of Chebyshev expansion coefficients. Classical estimates, including those due to Trefethen, are based on weighted bounded variation assumptions involving the singular weight $(1-x^{2})^{-1/2}$, which may be too restrictive for functions with limited regularity at the endpoints.\n  In this paper, we establish a new error bound for Gauss--Christoffel quadrature under weakened regularity assumptions. The analysis relies on a new identity for higher-order derivatives of Chebyshev polynomials. As a consequence, we obtain an improved decay estimate for Chebyshev coefficients, where the classical weighted condition \\[ V_{r}=\\int_{-1}^{1}\\frac{|f^{(r+1)}(x)|}{\\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}\\,dx \\] is replaced by the weaker condition \\[ U_{r}=\\int_{-1}^{1}|f^{(r+1)}(x)|\\,dx. \\]\n  This result leads to a corresponding error estimate for the Gauss--Christoffel quadrature rule, which is less restrictive than previous bounds.

We consider separate reduced spaces for fluid velocity, fluid pressure and solid displacement; we enrich the velocity space with supremizer modes to ensure the inf-sup stability of the fluid subproblem; we consider bubble-port decomposition of fluid velocity and solid displacement to satisfy the kinematic conditions at the fluid structure interface. We resort to Galerkin projection to define the semi-discrete reduced-order model and we consider a Radau-IIA IRK method for time integration: the resulting algebraic system is solved using static condensation of the interface degrees of freedom. The reduced-order model preserves a semi-discrete energy balance inherited from the full-order model, and avoids the need for additional interface enrichment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed combination of high-order IRK schemes with bubble-port decoupling of velocity and displacement degrees of freedom yields stable and accurate reduced-order model for long-time integration of strongly-coupled parametric FSI problems.",

The numerical model is implemented in the open-source finite element framework Firedrake, which enables the use of a high-order polynomial basis on unstructured meshes through weak formulations. Additionally, the curvature of the free surface and submerged bodies is incorporated through curvilinear elements obtained via transfinite linear blending, which conserves the high-order convergent properties of the overall scheme. The model is applied to several benchmark cases in two spatial dimensions. Initially, it addresses fixed-domain problems, including the lid-driven cavity flow and flows around bodies such as a cylinder and a NACA airfoil. Subsequently, with the presence of a free surface, it is extended to determine the flow around a bathymetry bump and a submerged NACA airfoil. The results confirm the high-order accuracy of the model through convergence studies and demonstrate a substantial speed-up over low-order numerical schemes.",

Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks.

Second, any finitely additive sequential extension preserving rank calibration is nonconglomerable, implying countable Dutch-book vulnerabilities. Third, rank-calibrated updates cannot be realized as regular conditionals of any countably additive exchangeable law on Y^infty. Fourth, formalizing both paradigms as families of one-step predictive kernels, conformal and Bayesian kernels coincide only on a Baire-meagre subset of the space of predictive laws.\n  We further show that rank- and proxy-based reductions are generically Blackwell-deficient relative to full-data experiments, yielding positive Le Cam deficiency for suitable losses. Extending the analysis to prediction-powered inference (PPI) yields an analogous message: bias-corrected, proxy-rectified estimators can be valid as confidence devices while failing to define transportable belief states across stages, shifts, or adaptive selection. Together, the results sharpen a general limitation of wrappers: finite-sample calibration guarantees do not by themselves supply composable semantics for sequential updating or downstream decision-making.",

We find (or confirm) $m$ for equilateral triangles, squares, and various types of rectangles. Also, we extend the problem from homothety to general similarity, or to similarity generated using some special rotations. In particular, we compute Gallai similarity numbers for lattice rectangles similar to $1\\times k$ (in all orientations) for $k=2,3,4$. The solutions have been found in the framework of the Satisfiability Problem in Propositional Logic (SAT). While some questions were solved using managed brute force, for the more computationally intensive questions we used modern SAT solvers together with symmetry breaking techniques. Some other minor questions are solved for triangles and squares, and new lower bounds are found for regular hexagons on the triangular lattice and for three-dimensional cubes in $\\Z^3$.",

    "abstract": "Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is regarded as a key enabling technique for sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems for its powerful interference management substantially enhancing link throughput. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can effectively shape the wireless propagation to match the environment and improve communication performance. However, in conventional RSMA-RIS architectures, the antenna elements are fixed, which underutilizes spatial degrees of freedom and hence constrains system performance. To address this limitation, we propose a movable-antenna (MA) assisted RSMA-RIS framework and formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming matrix, the RIS reflection matrix, the common-rate partition, and the MA positions. The original problem is equivalently transformed by employing the fractional programming (FP) method, and a closed-form solution for the common rate splitting is derived. Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we obtain iterative updates for the Lagrange multipliers together with a closed-form expression for the beamforming matrix. We then develop an update rule for the RIS reflection matrix via the dual problem, and finally determine the optimal antenna locations using a gradient-ascent procedure. Numerical results indicate that, even in the presence of RIS assistance, incorporating MAs yields additional performance improvements for RSMA. Moreover, relative to space-division multiple access (SDMA), the assistance of MA yields a greater performance gain for RSMA.",

Extending the framework of [7,8] from rectangular to triangular meshes, we introduce three procedures for constructing high-degree Frenet-IFE spaces: an initial construction based on monomial bases, a generalized construction using orthogonal polynomials, and reconstruction methods aimed at improving the conditioning of the associated mass matrix. The optimal approximation capability of the proposed IFE spaces is demonstrated through numerical examples.

    "abstract": "In plasma edge simulations, the behavior of neutral particles is often described by a Boltzmann--BGK equation. Solving this kinetic equation and estimating the moments of its solution are essential tasks, typically carried out using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. However, for large-sized reactors, like ITER and DEMO, high collision rates lead to a substantial computational cost. To accelerate the calculation, an asymptotic-preserving kinetic-diffusion Monte Carlo (KDMC) simulation method (Mortier et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2022) and a corresponding fluid estimation technique (Mortier et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys., 2022) have recently been proposed. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the convergence of KDMC combined with the associated fluid estimation. The analysis consists of proving theoretical upper bounds for both KDMC and the fluid estimation, and numerical verifications of these bounds. In addition, we compare the analyzed algorithm with a purely fluid-based method using the fully kinetic MC method as a reference. The algorithm consistently achieves lower error than the fluid-based method, and even one order of magnitude lower in a fusion-relevant test case. Moreover, the algorithm exhibits a significant speedup compared to the reference kinetic MC method. Overall, our analysis confirms the effectiveness of KDMC with the associated fluid estimation in nuclear fusion applications.",

    "abstract": "Argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) have been extensively developed, but existing higher-order bipolar $AF$s suffer from critical limitations: attackers and supporters are restricted to arguments, multi-valued and fuzzy semantics lack unified generalization, and encodings often rely on complex logics with poor interoperability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a higher-order argumentation framework with supports ($HAFS$), which explicitly allows attacks and supports to act as both targets and sources of interactions. We define a suite of semantics for $HAFS$s, including extension-based semantics, adjacent complete labelling semantics (a 3-valued semantics), and numerical equational semantics ([0,1]-valued semantics). Furthermore, we develop a normal encoding methodology to translate $HAFS$s into propositional logic systems ($\\mathcal{PLS}$s): $HAFS$s under complete labelling semantics are encoded into \u0141ukasiewicz's three-valued propositional logic ($\\mathcal{PL}_3^L$), and those under equational semantics are encoded into fuzzy $\\mathcal{PLS}$s ($\\mathcal{PL}_{[0,1]}$) such as G\u00f6del and Product fuzzy logics. We prove model equivalence between $HAFS$s and their encoded logical formulas, establishing the logical foundation of $HAFS$ semantics. Additionally, we investigate the relationships between 3-valued complete semantics and fuzzy equational semantics, showing that models of fuzzy encoded semantics can be transformed into complete semantics models via ternarization, and vice versa for specific t-norms. This work advances the formalization and logical encoding of higher-order bipolar argumentation, enabling seamless integration with lightweight computational solvers and uniform handling of uncertainty.",

We show that the leading coefficient of $F_K$ is a monomial and express its exponent in terms of the Hopf invariant for all homogeneous braid knots and fibered knots up to 12 crossings. As an application, we deduce an explicit formula for the Hopf invariant in terms of colored Jones polynomials.\n  For non-fibered strongly quasipositive knots, we study a relation between $F_K$ and the stability series of the colored Jones function, and explore similarities between $F_K$ and knot Floer homology. Finally, we propose a slope conjecture for $F_K$, relating it to the boundary slopes of the knot.",

We derive an upper bound expressed in terms of quantities that can be explicitly computed in many cases. This bound implies a two-sided estimate, up to a factor given by a power of an iterated logarithm. This factor is considerably smaller than the natural scale of the problem. Our result thus provides positive evidence supporting a conjecture formulated by Rafal Latala and Jan Swiatkowski.",

    "abstract": "We propose a nonparametric method to learn the L\u00e9vy density from probability density data governed by a nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation. We recast the problem as identifying the kernel in a nonlocal integral operator from discrete data, which leads to an ill-posed inverse problem. To regularize it, we construct an adaptive reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) whose kernel is built directly from the data. Under standard source and spectral decay conditions, we show that the reconstruction error decays in the mesh size at a near optimal rate. Importantly, we develop a generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based bilevel optimization algorithm to choose the regularization parameter, leading to efficient and robust computation of the regularized estimator. Numerical experiments for several L\u00e9vy densities, drift fields and data types (PDE-based densities and sample ensemble-based KDE reconstructions) demonstrate that our bilevel RKHS method outperforms classical L-curve and generalized cross-validation strategies and that the adaptive RKHS norm is more accurate and robust than $L^2_\u03c1$- and $\\ell^2$-based regularization.",

We introduce the notion of adapted complex structure, namely a complex structure that maps vertices and edges of the graph to vertices and edges, and we analyze in depth the restrictions imposed by the integrability condition. We completely characterize the graphs that admit abelian adapted complex structures, showing that they belong to a small family of graphs that we call basic. We prove that any graph endowed with an adapted complex structure $J$ contains a unique $J$-invariant basic spanning subgraph, and conversely, that every such graph can be constructed through a systematic expansion procedure starting from a basic graph. We also explore geometric and combinatorial consequences, including the existence of special Hermitian metrics as well as other graph-theoretic properties.",

Building on the projection-onto-linear-variety (PLV) algorithm, an affine-projection approach introduced by Miretti \\emph{et. al.}, we analyze PLV in a well-defined \\emph{weighted} Fourier-domain to emphasize its geometric interpretability. This yields an explicit fixed-dimensional trigonometric-polynomial representation and a closed-form solution via a positive-definite matrix, which directly implies uniqueness. We further establish an exact energy identity that yields the APS reconstruction error and leads to a sharp identifiability/resolution characterization: PLV achieves perfect recovery if and only if the ground-truth APS lies in the identified trigonometric-polynomial subspace; otherwise it returns the minimum-energy APS among all covariance-consistent spectra.",

Under a condition on the $G$-decomposition of the associated variation of Hodge structures, we prove a criterion for the maximality of the monodromy.

As a consequence of our criterion, we show that for $g\\geq 8$ there exists no special family of Galois covers of the type we consider, providing new evidence towards the Coleman-Oort conjecture.

    "abstract": "We study the family of commutative subspaces in the trigonometric holonomy Lie algebra $t^{\\mathrm{trig}}_\u03a6$, introduced by Toledano Laredo, for an arbitrary root system $\u03a6$. We call these subspaces \\emph{Bethe subspaces} because they can be regarded as quadratic components of \\emph{Bethe subalgebras} in the Yangian corresponding to the root system $\u03a6$, that are responsible for integrals of the generalized XXX Heisenberg spin chain. Bethe subspaces are naturally parametrized by the complement of the corresponding toric arrangement . We prove that this family extends regularly to the minimal wonderful model $X_\u03a6$ of the toric arrangement described by De Concini and Gaiffi, thus giving a compactification of the parameter space for Bethe subspaces. For classical types $A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n$, we show that this extension is faithful. As a special case, when $\u03a6$ is of type $A_n$, our construction agrees with the main result of Aguirre--Felder--Veselov on the closure of the set of quadratic Gaudin subalgebras. Our work is also closely related to, and refines in this root system setting, a parallel compactification result of J. Peters obtained for more general toric arrangements arising from quantum multiplication on hypertoric varieties. Next, we show that the Bethe subspaces assemble into a vector bundle over $X_\u03a6$, which we identify with the logarithmic tangent bundle of $X_\u03a6$. Finally, we formulate conjectures extending these results to the setting of Bethe subalgebras in Yangians and to the quantum cohomology rings of Springer resolutions. We plan to address this in our next papers.",

In contrast to the classical analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition, we additionally use the decomposition of a function into functions with different parity, which adds the additional parameter $\\boldsymbol \u03be$. The natural geometry on the sphere naturally leads to the dependencies between the input variables. Using certain orthogonal basis functions for the function approximation, we are able to model high-dimensional functions with low-dimensional variable interactions.",

We give three examples of such quantum dilogarithms, leading to integrable 3D lattice models.
