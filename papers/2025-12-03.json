    "abstract": "This paper studies the continuous-time reinforcement learning for stochastic singular control with the application to an infinite-horizon irreversible reinsurance problems. The singular control is equivalently characterized as a pair of regions of time and the augmented states, called the singular control law. To encourage the exploration in the learning procedure, we propose a randomization method for the singular control laws, new to the literature, by considering an auxiliary singular control and entropy regularization. The exploratory singular control problem is formulated as a two-stage optimal control problem, where the time-inconsistency issue arises in the outer problem. In the specific model setup with known model coefficients, we provide the full characterization of the time-consistent equilibrium singular controls for the two-stage problem. Taking advantage of the solution structure, we can consider the proper parameterization of the randomized equilibrium policy and the value function when the model is unknown and further devise the actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithms. In the numerical experiment, we present the superior convergence of parameter iterations towards the true values based on the randomized equilibrium policy and illustrate how the exploration may advance the learning performance in the context of singular controls.",

    "abstract": "Existing theoretical analyses of satellite mega-constellations often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as short serving times, or lack tractability when evaluating realistic handover strategies. Motivated by these limitations, this paper develops a general analytical framework for accurately characterising the ergodic capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks under arbitrary handover strategies. Specifically, we model the transmission link as shadowed-Rician fading and introduce the persistent satellite channel, wherein the channel process is governed by an i.i.d. renewal process under mild assumptions of uncoordinated handover decisions and knowledge of satellite ephemeris and fading parameters. Within this framework, we derive the ergodic capacity (persistent capacity) of the persistent satellite channel using renewal theory and establish its relation to the non-persistent capacity studied in prior work. To address computational challenges, we present closed-form upper and lower bounds on persistent capacity. The optimal handover problem is formulated as a non-linear fractional program, obtaining an explicit decision rule via a variant of Dinkelbach's algorithm. We further demonstrate that a simpler handover strategy maximising serving capacity closely approximates the optimal strategy, providing practical insights for designing high-throughput LEO satellite communication systems.",

    "abstract": "We establish error estimates for semi-Lagrangian schemes for the initial value problem of one-dimensional conservation laws with a dispersive term, including the Korteweg--de Vries equation. The schemes considered in this paper are based on the semi-Lagrangian technique combined with spatial discretization by higher-order interpolation operators. For the semi-Lagrangian schemes equipped with the spline or Hermite interpolation operators of order $ 2 s - 1 $, we derive an $L^2$-error estimate of $ O (\u0394t^r + h^{2s} / \u0394t) $ and an $ H^s $-error estimate of $ O (\u0394t^r + h^{s} / \\sqrt{\u0394t}) $, where $ h $ and $ \u0394t $ denote the spatial mesh size and the time step size, respectively, and $ r \\in \\lparen 0, 1\\rbrack $ is a parameter determined by the discretization of the dispersive term. A key step in the analysis is to establish the stability of the interpolation operators. Under suitable assumptions, interpolation operators of order $ 2s - 1 $ are stable with respect to the $ H^s $-norm as well as a weighted $ H^s $-norm. The weighted $H^s$-norm depends on $h$ and $\u0394t$, and it reduces to the $L^2$-norm in the limit $ h \\to 0 $.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed to meet the demand for reliable communication in high-mobility scenarios for future wireless networks. However, in multi-user OTFS systems, conventional embedded pilot schemes require independent pilot allocation for each user, leading to linearly increasing pilot overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate the uplink channel estimation and pilot design for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS systems. We propose a multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first estimates the angles of arrivals (AoAs) via subspace decomposition-based method. A spatial projection matrix, constructed from the estimated AOAs, decouples the received signal by propagation path subspace, effectively mitigating inter-path interference. The remaining fractional delay and Doppler can be obtained by a compressed sensing (CS)-based off-grid channel estimation method. Furthermore, to reduce the pilot overhead in multi-user OTFS systems, this paper proposes a novel cyclic shift embedded pilot (CSEP) structure, which can reuse users through cyclic shift-orthogonality of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. Compared with conventional embedded pilot structures, the CSEP structure can save over 30\\% of pilot overhead. Finally, an imporved channel estimation method based on the CSEP structure is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that it achieves superior performance in channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed CSEP structure and channel estimation algorithm achieve a favorable balance between computational complexity, estimation accuracy, and bit error rate (BER) performance.",

    "abstract": "Fox's conjecture (1962) states that the sequence of absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of alternating links is trapezoidal. While the conjecture remains open in general, a number of special cases have been settled, some, quite recently: Fox's conjecture was shown to hold for special alternating links by Hafner, M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, and Vidinas (2023) and for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links by Azarpendar, Juh\u00e1sz, and K\u00e1lm\u00e1n (2024). Any alternating link can be written as a diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links; thus, if one could remove the certain adjective in the previous result, it would settle Fox's conjecture. In this paper, we give an alternative proof of Azarpendar, Juh\u00e1sz, and K\u00e1lm\u00e1n's aforementioned result via a dimer model for the Alexander polynomial. In doing so, we not only obtain a significantly shorter proof of Azarpendar, Juh\u00e1sz, and K\u00e1lm\u00e1n's result than the original, but we also obtain several theorems of independent interest regarding the Alexander polynomial, which are readily visible from the dimer point of view. Moreover, we explain, backed with computational evidence, why our result is only for certain diagrammatic Murasugi sums of special alternating links as opposed to all. While the latter does not settle an open question, it strikes us as important to bring to attention, given the interest in finding a solution to Fox's conjecture.",

The 2RC model is applied to a set of twelve batteries using four publicly available datasets obtained from well-established research institutions. The methodology is structured in four stages: first, the 2RC model is selected due to its balance between physical interpretability and computational simplicity; second, experimental charge-discharge cycle data are collected; third, various optimization techniques are applied with the aim of minimizing the error between the experimental data and the response estimated by the model; and finally, accuracy is evaluated using the mean squared error, while computational efficiency is assessed through execution time. Traditional, metaheuristic, and bio-inspired optimization methods are considered, including least squares optimization, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and several nature-inspired variants. It is demonstrated that bio-inspired techniques achieve greater accuracy than traditional methods, without a significant increase in computational cost. In particular, particle swarm optimization shows superior performance in terms of precision and robustness against local minima. It is concluded that the integration of advanced optimization strategies significantly enhances the fidelity of equivalent electrical models, which is essential for accurate estimation of internal states such as state of charge, aging, and service life in lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles and aerospace systems.",

    "abstract": "Cell-edge users (CEUs) in cellular networks typically suffer from poor channel conditions due to long distances from serving base stations and physical obstructions, resulting in much lower data rates compared to cell-center users (CCUs). This paper proposes an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-assisted cellular network with intelligent power control to address the performance gap between CEUs and CCUs. Unlike conventional approaches that either deploy UAVs for all users or use no UAV assistance, our model uses a distance-based criterion where only users beyond a reference distance receive UAV relay assistance. Each UAV operates as an amplify-and-forward relay, enabling assisted users to receive signals from both the base station and the UAV simultaneously, thereby achieving diversity gain. To optimize transmission power allocation across base stations, we employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning framework that learns power control policies without requiring accurate channel models. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves a peak average rate of 2.28 bps/Hz at the optimal reference distance of 400m, which represents a 3.6% improvement compared to networks without UAV assistance and 0.9% improvement compared to networks where all users receive UAV support. The results also reveal that UAV altitude and reference distance are critical factors affecting system performance, with lower altitudes providing better performance.",

For a Hecke eigenform of arbitrary weight, we prove the existence of an associated two-dimensional representation of the absolute Galois group of $F$. Furthermore, for any such irreducible Galois representation, we formulate a conjecture predicting the set of weights of eigenforms from which it arises. This generalizes Edixhoven's variant of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture (in the case $F = \\mathbb{Q}$), and removes the restriction that $p$ be unramified in $F$ from prior work in this direction. We also establish one direction of a conjectural relation with the algebraic analogue of the weight part of Serre's Conjecture in this context. Finally, we prove results towards our conjecture in the case of partial weight one for real quadratic fields $F$ in which $p$ is ramified.",

Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. For such cycles we prove that the $3$-antiprism $A(3)$ (octahedron) has exactly $2$ combinatorially different cycles, the $4$-antiprism $A(4)$ has exactly $7$ combinatorially different cycles, and these cycles correspond to $7$ cycles (perhaps combinatorially equivalent) on any polytope different from antiprisms, and any antiprism $A(k)$ has at least $2$ combinatorially different cycles.

Recently, Zhao and Guo (2022) has established the global stability of PID control for a class of uncertain nonlinear control systems with relative degree two without random perturbations. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of nonlinear stochastic systems with an arbitrary relative degree $n$, and discuss the stability and design of extended PID controller (a natural extension of PID). We demonstrate that, the closed-loop control systems will be globally stable in mean square with bounded tracking errors provided the extended PID parameters are selected from an $(n+1)$-dimensional unbounded set, even if both the system nonlinear drift and diffusion terms contain a wide range of structural uncertainties. Moreover, the steady-state tracking error is proved to be proportional to the noise intensity at the setpoint, which can also be made arbitrarily small by choosing the controller parameters suitably large.",

We illustrate its behavior on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the index provides a coherent assessment even when traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in resource-allocation settings, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects severe density-geometry inconsistency with high sensitivity, but also offers a smooth, optimization-ready objective that naturally favors allocations balancing demographic weight with each group's effective spread in the outcome space, while providing a smooth, gradient-friendly regularizer that can be easily embedded in modern policy-making and algorithmic governance optimization frameworks.",

The lengths of these codes can reach up to $\\frac{q+3}{2}$ (for finite fields of odd characteristic) and $\\frac{q+4}{2}$ (for even characteristic), respectively. Owing to their special structure, we can use the Cauchy matrix method to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for these codes to be MDS codes and non-GRS MDS codes. Additionally, the inequivalence between these codes and twisted GRS codes is analyzed. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships among several existing classes of codes used for constructing non-GRS MDS codes, propose explicit constructions, and discuss the lengths of non-GRS MDS codes based on these constructions. Finally, we design two efficient algorithms to address two main problems in GRS code research, i.e., determining whether an unknown code $C$ is a GRS code from its generator matrix $G$, and recovering the key vectors $\\bm\u03b1$ and $\\bm{v}$ such that $C = \\GRS_{n,k}(\\bm\u03b1, \\bm{v})$ if $C$ is indeed a GRS code.

    "abstract": "For certain groups, parabolic subgroups appear as stabilizers of flags of sets or vector spaces. Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative \"chain rules\" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals.",

We focus on the practical realization of this iterative approach, leveraging sum-factorization and explicit SIMD vectorization to minimize memory footprint and maximize arithmetic throughput. The performance analysis demonstrates that the solver effectively hides data-fetching latencies and maintains optimal $\\mathcal{O}(p^d)$ memory scaling, even when dominated by geometric data on distorted meshes.

    "abstract": "This work focuses on the development of efficient solvers for the pseudo-stress formulation of the unsteady Stokes problem, discretised by means of a discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids (PolyDG). The introduction of the pseudo-stress variable is motivated by the growing interest in non-Newtonian flow models and coupled interface problems, where the stress field plays a fundamental role in the physical description. The space-time discretisation of the problem is obtained by combining the PolyDG approach in space with the implicit Euler method for time integration. The resulting linear system, characterised by a symmetric, positive, definite matrix, exhibits deteriorating convergence with standard solvers as the time step decreases. To address this issue, we investigate two tailored strategies: deflated Conjugate Gradient, which mitigates the effect of the most problematic eigenmodes, and collective Block-Jacobi, which exploits the block structure of the system matrix. Numerical experiments show that both approaches yield iteration counts effectively independent of $\u0394t$, ensuring robust performance with respect to the time step. Future work will focus on extending this robustness to the spatial discretisation parameter $h$ by integrating multigrid strategies with the time-robust solvers developed in this study.",

A central technical tool is a structural lemma that materializes part of the mutual information between two random variables, implicitly capturing the effect of infinitely many non-Shannon--type inequalities. This leads to conceptually transparent proofs without explicitly invoking such infinite families.

The model is highly accessible to rigorous mathematical analysis, and has been studied as a paradigm for effects like total and partial synchronization.\n  Most initial conditions $\\boldsymbol{\\vartheta}$ lead to total synchronization. The plethora of $2^N-1$ (circles of) partially synchronized states, however, is unstable. The precise behavior of transitions to synchrony seems to have eluded description. In the present paper, we address this gap.\n  By the gradient structure of (*), the global dynamics decompose into equilibria and heteroclinic orbits between them. Except for the extremes of total instability and total synchrony, all equilibria are 2-cluster solutions: their phase angles $\\vartheta_j$ attain only two values, with a phase difference of $\u03c0$ between them.\n  Any heteroclinic orbit between 2-cluster equilibria, or towards synchrony, can be realized as a 3-cluster rebellion. Cluster rebellions split the smaller, \"slim\", minority cluster of the source equilibrium and send the rebellious part to join the bigger, \"fat\", majority cluster.\n  Heteroclinic transversality identifies the Kuramoto model as a structurally stable Morse-Smale system. In particular, heteroclinic orbits can be concatenated in finite time. The options involved in successive cluster rebellions amount to finite symbol sequences of 2-shift type.\n  The paper is dedicated to Professor Yoshiki Kuramoto, with admiration.",

In this paper, we study a modification of this distance that also takes topological differences into account. The resulting function of pairs of metric spaces is called the continuous GH-distance. We show that many basic properties of the classical GH-distance also hold in the continuous case. However, the continuous GH-distance, distinguishing between topologies, can differ significantly from the classical one. We will provide numerous examples of this distinction and demonstrate the role of topological dimension here. In particular, we will prove that the continuous GH-distance, like the classical one, is intrinsic, but, unlike the classical one, it is incomplete. Since we are dealing with all metric spaces, we will show, within the framework of the von Neumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del set theory, how topological concepts can be transferred to proper classes.",

In this paper, we study the Ursell function in Ising lattice gauge theory. When the spins at the edges are used as random variables, we show that $U_n$ can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the configuration and the parameter $\u03b2$. When considering Wilson loops observables as random variables, using the tool of cluster expansion adapted to this setting, we prove that at sufficiently low temperature, for any number $n$ of disjoint Wilson loops, there exists a configuration of loops such that the Ursell function $U_n$ is positive.

The results show that (1) the surrogate neural network performs well across three different architectures, (2) the proposed approach is up to 34.72 times faster than the direct solution of the monolithic deterministic equivalent counterpart, (3) the surrogate-based solutions yield comparable in-sample stability and improved out-of-sample performance relative to the deterministic equivalent, indicating better generalisation to unseen scenarios. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) we propose a machine-learning-based framework for solving multi-horizon stochastic programs, (2) we introduce a neural network embedding formulation tailored to multi-horizon stochastic programs with continuous first-stage decisions and fixed scenario sets, extending existing surrogate modelling approaches from two-stage to multi-horizon settings, and (3) we provide an extensive computational study on a realistic UK power system planning problem, demonstrating the trade-off between approximation accuracy, computational efficiency, and solution robustness for different neural network architectures and scenario set sizes.",

Although the Kuramoto model has become one of the most widely used paradigms for describing synchronization phenomena-appearing in more than 100,000 scientific studies-the fundamental relationships among distinct synchronization states remain unresolved. In this work, we rigorously prove that full phase-locking, phase-locking, frequency synchronization, and order-parameter synchronization are equivalent for arbitrary hybrid ensembles. The proof combines dissipative energy methods, LaSalle-type compactness arguments, the Poincar\u00e9-Bendixson theorem, and Thieme's asymptotically autonomous theory to demonstrate that synchronization equivalence is topological, determined solely by the finite equilibrium structure of the all-to-all network. This result provides a mathematically complete characterization of synchronization in finite oscillator systems and clarifies its geometric invariance across first-, second-, and hybrid-order models.",

We provide a novel $n$-dimensional formulation of this model for any $n \\geq 3$ and derive its mean-field kinetic formulation using bundle geometry concepts. The target of the paper is the derivation of a fluid model in the hydrodynamic limit. We show that this fluid model is the \"self-organized hydrodynamic\" (SOH) model already found in earlier work pertaining to the Vicsek model. The derivation is based on the introduction of appropriate \"generalized collision invariants\" (GCI). The action of the $n$-dimensional orthogonal group is used to reduce the expression of the GCI to a set of two functions satisfying a system of equations which is solved by means of a variational formulation. This leads to explicit formulas for the coefficients of the SOH model in terms of those of the original interacting particle system.",

We construct a new globally-conforming discrete space, departing from standard discontinuous Trefftz formulations, and investigate its approximation properties, providing wavenumber-explicit best-approximation error estimates. The mesh is defined by intersecting the domain with a Cartesian grid, and the basis functions are continuous in the whole computational domain, compactly supported, and can be expressed as simple linear combinations of EPWs within each element. This ensures they remain local solutions to the Helmholtz equation and allows the system matrix to be assembled in closed form for polygonal domains. The discrete space provides stable approximations with bounded coefficients and spectral accuracy for analytic Helmholtz solutions. The approximation error is proved to decay exponentially both at a fixed frequency, with respect to the discretization parameters, and along suitable sequences of increasing wavenumbers, with the number of degrees of freedom scaling linearly with the frequency. Numerical results confirm these theoretical estimates for the full Galerkin error.",

    "abstract": "With the evolution of wireless systems toward large-scale arrays and high-frequency reconfigurable architectures, fluid antenna systems (FAS) operating in the near-field (NF) regime provide new degrees of freedom (DoF) for physical layer security (PLS). This paper proposes an artificial-noise (AN)-aided PLS scheme for NF fluid-antenna multiple-input multiple-output (FA-MIMO) systems, with joint beamforming (BF) and AN design for both compact and large arrays. An alternating-optimization (AO) framework addresses the sparsity-constrained non-convex design by splitting it into a continuous BF/AN joint-design subproblem and a discrete FAS port-selection subproblem. Closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions are obtained via a generalized spectral water-filling procedure within a block coordinate descent (BCD) surrogate and realized by a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture that embeds AN in the baseband without extra radio-frequency (RF) chains. For FAS port selection, a row-energy based prune--refit rule, aligned with Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of a group-sparsity surrogate, enables efficient active-port determination. Simulation results confirm that the proposed design exploits the geometry and position-domain DoF of FAS and significantly improves secrecy performance, particularly for non-extremely-large arrays where NF beam focusing alone is inadequate.",

We show that two-dimensional continuous piecewise-linear maps near certain codimension-two homoclinic bifurcations are well approximated by a three-parameter family of one-dimensional maps. Each member of the one-dimensional family is discontinuous, because the family is constructed from the first return of iterates to a subset of phase space, and comprised of infinitely many linear pieces, where each piece corresponds to a fixed number of iterations near the saddle associated with the homoclinic bifurcation. The one-dimensional family exhibits period-incrementing, period-adding, bandcount-incrementing, and bandcount-adding structures (all typical for two-piece maps), as well as unique features caused by orbits repeatedly visiting more than two pieces of the map. These structures carry through to the two-dimensional maps with only minor differences in the arrangement of the bifurcations developing with the distance from the codimension-two bifurcations.

In this setting and under adequate conditions, we establish a general third moment theorem for the normalized functionals. Building on this result, we obtain the first quantitative bounds in the Wasserstein distance for a variety of moving-measure models initialized by Poisson-driven clouds of points, turning qualitative central limit theorems into explicit rates of convergence. The scope of the approach is then demonstrated through several examples, including systems driven by fractional Brownian motion, $\u03b1$-stable processes, uniformly elliptic diffusions, and spectral empirical measures arising from Dyson Brownian motion, all under broad assumptions on the control measure of the initial Poisson configuration. The analysis relies on a combination of Stein's method with Mecke's formula, in the spirit of the Poisson Malliavin-Stein methodology.",

We show that two-dimensional continuous piecewise-linear maps near certain codimension-two homoclinic bifurcations are well approximated by a three-parameter family of one-dimensional maps. Each member of the one-dimensional family is discontinuous, because the family is constructed from the first return of iterates to a subset of phase space, and comprised of infinitely many linear pieces, where each piece corresponds to a fixed number of iterations near the saddle associated with the homoclinic bifurcation. The one-dimensional family exhibits period-incrementing, period-adding, bandcount-incrementing, and bandcount-adding structures (all typical for two-piece maps), as well as unique features caused by orbits repeatedly visiting more than two pieces of the map. These structures carry through to the two-dimensional maps with only minor differences in the arrangement of the bifurcations developing with the distance from the codimension-two bifurcations. This leads to a novel and vivid elucidation of the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form.",

As the interface self-intersects, Sobolev norms remain bounded, although analyticity is necessarily lost. This contrasts classical splash singularities, in which solutions remain analytic up to the time of self-intersection.\n  The narrowing gap bounded by these arcs is not occupied by plasma, as squeezing the plasma itself would cause blow-up in Sobolev norms. Instead, the gap represents the region outside the plasma, a vacuum carrying a nontrivial magnetic field. The plasma on either side pinches the field as the gap closes, and, in response, the field flattens to infinite order at the intersection point (and nowhere else), thereby forming an analytic singularity. This gives the first example of analytic breakdown without Sobolev blow-up in a locally well-posed free-boundary incompressible fluid system, and can be viewed as the first rigorous construction of a squeeze-type singularity, in which we study and quantify the precise behavior of an active, incompressible vector field as it is completely pinched off by a free-boundary in finite time.\n  The proof combines a magnetically-aligned Lagrangian formulation of ideal MHD together with weighted elliptic estimates in the vacuum that remain uniform as the width of the gap tends to zero. Our framework may provide a starting point for the analysis of squeeze-type singularities in other incompressible fluid models.",

Importantly, our framework establishes the convergence in the full-parameter space, resolving a critical gap of LoRA variants where low-rank updates lack such guarantees.

The resulting structure has a natural metric that allows for the study of differential operators and stochastic processes on the graph. Brownian motions in these domains have been extensively studied theoretically using their generators. However, less work has been done on practical algorithms for simulating these processes. We introduce the first algorithm for simulating Brownian motions on metric graphs through a timestep splitting Euler-Maruyama-based discretization of their corresponding stochastic differential equation. By applying this scheme to Langevin diffusions on metric graphs, we also obtain the first algorithm for sampling on metric graphs. We provide theoretical guarantees on the number of timestep splittings required for the algorithm to converge to the underlying stochastic process. We also show that the exit probabilities of the simulated particle converge to the vertex-edge jump probabilities of the underlying stochastic differential equation as the timestep goes to zero. Finally, since this method is highly parallelizable, we provide fast, memory-aware implementations of our algorithm in the form of custom CUDA kernels that are up to ~8000x faster than a GPU implementation using PyTorch on simple star metric graphs. Beyond simple star graphs, we benchmark our algorithm on a real cortical vascular network extracted from a DuMuX tissue-perfusion model for tracer transport.

The resulting algorithm is distributed over the 2-hop Delaunay graph and, for small enough values of the perturbation parameter, achieves the same performance as its centralized counterpart. We also introduce three discrete-time versions that rely only on 1-hop communication at the cost of having to use delayed information and formally establish their asymptotic convergence properties.

Set theory with atoms is used to reason about these objects. Recent work assumes that $\\mathbb{A}$ is countable and that the symmetries are the automorphisms of a structure on $\\mathbb{A}$. We study this set theory to understand generalisations of this approach. We show that: this construction is well-defined and sufficiently expressive; and that automorphism groups are adequate.\n  Certain uncountable structures appear similar to countable structures, suggesting that the theory of orbit-finite constructions may apply to these uncountable structures. We prove results guaranteeing that the theory of symmetries of two structures are equal. Let: $PM(\\mathcal{A})$ be the universe of symmetries induced by adding atoms in bijection with $\\mathcal{A}$ and considering the symmetric universe; $\\underline{\\mathcal{A}}$ be the image of $\\mathcal{A}$ on the atoms; and $\u03c6^{PM(\\mathcal{A})}$ be the relativisation of $\u03c6$ to $PM(\\mathcal{A})$. We prove that all symmetric universes of equality atoms have theory $Th(PM(\\left\\langle \\mathbb{N}\\right\\rangle))$. We prove that for structures $\\mathcal{A}$, `nicely' covered by a set of cardinality $\u03ba$, there is a structure $\\mathcal{B}\\equiv\\mathcal{A}$ of size $\u03ba$ such that for all formulae $\u03c6(x)$ in one variable, \\begin{equation*}\n  ZFC\\vdash \u03c6(\\underline{\\mathcal{A}})^{PM(\\mathcal{A})}\\leftrightarrow\u03c6(\\underline{\\mathcal{B}})^{PM(\\mathcal{B})} \\end{equation*}",

The preconditioner is based on an augmented Lagrangian approach of the full discretization. Unlike standard grad-div type augmentation, however, we consider augmentation based on divergence-conformity. With this augmentation we introduce two different, well-conditioned, and easy to solve matrices to approximate the trace pressure Schur complement. To introduce a completely algebraic solver, we propose to use multifrontal sparse LU solvers using butterfly compression to solve the trace velocity block. Numerical examples demonstrate that the trace pressure Schur complement is highly robust in mesh spacing and Reynolds number and that the multifrontal inexact LU performs well for a wide range of Reynolds numbers.",

This metric measures the maximal bottleneck distance between the persistence diagrams associated with the convex combinations of the two function components. Similarly to the traditional matching distance, the convex matching distance aggregates the information provided by two real-valued components. However, whereas the matching distance depends on two parameters, the convex matching distance depends on only one, offering improved computational efficiency. We further show that the convex matching distance can be more discriminative than the traditional matching distance in certain cases, although the two metrics are generally not comparable. Moreover, we prove that the convex matching distance is stable and characterize the coefficients of the convex combination at which it is attained. Finally, we demonstrate that this new aggregation framework benefits from the computational advantages provided by the Pareto grid, a collection of curves in the plane whose points lie in the image of the Pareto critical set associated with functions assuming values on the real plane.",

    "abstract": "The Kepler problem in classical mechanics exhibits a rich structure of conserved quantities, highlighted by the Laplace--Runge--Lenz (LRL) vector. Through Noether's theorem in reverse, the LRL vector gives rise to a corresponding infinitesimal dynamical symmetry on the kinematical variables, which is well known in the literature. However, the physically relevant part of the LRL vector is its direction angle in the plane of motion (since its magnitude is just a function of energy and angular momentum). The present work derives the infinitesimal dynamical symmetry corresponding to the direction part of the LRL vector, and obtains the explicit form of the symmetry transformations that it generates. When combined with the rotation symmetries,the resulting symmetry group is shown to be the semi-direct product of $SO(3)$ and $R^3$. This stands in contrast to the $SO(4)$ symmetry group generated by the LRL symmetries and the rotations. As a by-product, the action of the new infinitesimal symmetries on all of the conserved quanties is obtained. The results are given in terms of the physical kinematical variables in the Kepler problem, rather than in an enlarged auxiliary space in which the LRL symmetries are usually stated.",

    "abstract": "Many modern datasets consist of multiple related matrices measured on a common set of units, where the goal is to recover the shared low-dimensional subspace. While the Angle-based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) framework provides a solution, it relies on equal-weight aggregation, which can be strictly suboptimal when views exhibit significant statistical heterogeneity (arising from varying SNR and dimensions) and structural heterogeneity (arising from individual components). In this paper, we propose HeteroJIVE, a weighted two-stage spectral algorithm tailored to such heterogeneity. Theoretically, we first revisit the ``non-diminishing\" error barrier with respect to the number of views $K$ identified in recent literature for the equal-weight case. We demonstrate that this barrier is not universal: under generic geometric conditions, the bias term vanishes and our estimator achieves the $O(K^{-1/2})$ rate without the need for iterative refinement. Extending this to the general-weight case, we establish error bounds that explicitly disentangle the two layers of heterogeneity. Based on this, we derive an oracle-optimal weighting scheme implemented via a data-driven procedure. Extensive simulations corroborate our theoretical findings, and an application to TCGA-BRCA multi-omics data validates the superiority of HeteroJIVE in practice.",

    "abstract": "We present a simple $q$-ary family of single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC--DED) linear codes whose parity checks are tied directly to the base-$p$ ($q=p$ prime) digits of the coordinate index. For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \\emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes.\n  Our contribution is not optimality but \\emph{implementational simplicity} and an \\emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior.",

To ensure the efficient operation of IIoT, it is imperative to develop communication-efficient methods for transmitting massive production data. This paper designs a communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithm for optimization problems subject to coupled equality constraints. While compressed communication is employed to enhance efficiency, it comes at the cost of introducing compression errors that may impair algorithm performance. To eliminate the influence of compression errors, differential compression techniques along with dynamic scaling factors are incorporated into the algorithm design. Linear convergence and constraint satisfaction of the algorithm are established under different types of compressors. Numerical results further demonstrate its effectiveness across three compression scenarios with specific quantizers.",

Furthermore, we extend the Farrell measure of technical efficiency using these new models.

Such operators have recently attracted significant interest from the research community, including in the context of stochastic homogenization. In particular, it has been proved that the spectrum of these operators may feature a band-gap structure in the regime where heterogeneities take place on a sufficiently small scale. However, the nature of the limiting (as the small scale tends to zero) spectrum in the above setting is non-classical and not completely understood. In this paper we prove for the first time that Anderson localization occurs near band edges, thus shedding light on the limiting spectral behaviour. Our results rely on recent nontrivial advancements in quantitative unique continuation for PDEs, in combination with assumptions on the model that are standard in the Anderson localization literature, and which we plan to relax in future works.",

    "title": "Age of Information for Constrained Scheduling with Imperfect Feedback",
    "abstract": "This paper considers a downlink system where an access point sends the monitored status of multiple sources to multiple users. By jointly accounting for imperfect feedback and constrained transmission rate, which are key limited factors in practical systems, we aim to design scheduling algorithms to optimize the age of information (AoI) over the infinite time horizon. For zero feedback under the generate-at-will traffic, we derive a closed-form lower bound of achievable AoI, which, to the best of our knowledge, reflects the impact of zero feedback for the first time, and propose a policy that achieves this bound in many cases by jointly applying rate splitting and modular arithmetic. For zero feedback under the Bernoulli traffic, we develop a drift-plus-penalty (DPP) policy with a threshold structure based on the theory of Lyapunov optimization and provide a closed-form performance guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the design of this DPP policy to support general imperfect feedback without increasing the online computational complexity. Numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and the AoI advantage of the proposed policies over state-of-the-art policies.",

    "title": "Three Dixon-Rosenfeld Planes",
    "abstract": "Rosenfeld postulated ``generalized'' projective planes, which exploit a correspondence between rank-one idempotents of Jordan algebras $\\mathfrak{J}_3(\\mathbb{A})$ and points of projective planes $\\mathbb{A}P^2$. The isometry groups of the generalized projective planes (which were later defined rigorously as homogeneous spaces) are entries of the Tits-Freudenthal magic square. Given recent interest in the Dixon algebra $\\mathbb{R}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}\\otimes\\mathbb{H}\\otimes\\mathbb{O}$, we extend Rosenfeld's approach and present three new coset manifolds. These \"Dixon-Rosenfeld planes\" have isometry algebras that are obtained from Tits' magic formula and involve all tensorial components of the Dixon algebra. We show that these are the only three planes obtainable with Tits' formula that preserve the analogy with Rosenfeld's planes. These non-simple Lie algebras generalize $\\mathfrak{f}_{4},\\mathfrak{e}_{6},\\mathfrak{e}_{7}$ and $\\mathfrak{e}_{8}$ for the octonionic plane $\\mathbb{O}P^{2}$ and in the octonionic Rosenfeld planes $\\left(\\mathbb{C}\\otimes\\mathbb{O}\\right)P^{2}$, $\\left(\\mathbb{H}\\otimes\\mathbb{O}\\right)P^{2}$ and $\\left(\\mathbb{O}\\otimes\\mathbb{O}\\right)P^{2}$. We finally investigate the relationships between the isometry algebras of the Dixon-Rosenfeld planes and the exceptional Lie algebras.",

We prove that a certain observable of the free boundary $q$-Whittaker process exhibits a $(q,t)$ symmetry after a random shift, generalizing a previous result of Imamura, Mucciconi, and Sasamoto, and an extension of that result due to the first author. Our proof is completely different, and as part of our proof, we find contour integral formulas for the free boundary $q$-Whittaker process. We also show a matching between certain observables in the free boundary Hall--Littlewood process and a quasi-open six vertex model, and explain how work of Finn and Vanicat gives an evaluation of a bounded sum over skew Hall--Littlewood functions as a rectangular Koornwinder polynomial.",

    "abstract": "We construct a manifest gauge invariant renormalization framework by first introducing a perturbative BRST Feynman graph complex and then combining it with Connes--Kreimer renormalization theory: To this end, we first formalize the cancellation identities of 't Hooft (1971), which were used to prove the absence of gauge anomalies in Quantum Yang--Mills theories. Specifically, we start with some reasonable axioms of (generalized) gauge theories and then present the most general version of cancellation identities ensuring transversality. Then, we construct a perturbative BRST Feynman graph complex, whose cohomology groups consist of transversal invariant linear combinations of Feynman graphs. We prove that the cohomology groups are zero in odd degree and generated by connected combinatorial Green's functions in even degree, with a corresponding number of external ghost edges. Ultimately, we then formulate the renormalization Hopf algebra on these cohomology groups, which directly links to Hopf subalgebras for multiplicative renormalization. Finally, we exemplify the developed theory with Quantum Yang--Mills theory and (effective) Quantum General Relativity.",

    "title": "An exact pricing algorithm for revenue maximization under the logit demand function",
    "abstract": "Determining the optimal selling price is a challenge in revenue management, especially in markets characterized by nonlinear and price-sensitive demand. While traditional models, such as linear, power, and exponential demand functions, offer analytical convenience, they often fail to capture realistic purchase dynamics, leading to suboptimal pricing. The logit demand function addresses these limitations through its bounded, S-shaped curve, offering a more realistic representation of consumer behavior. Despite its advantages, most existing literature relies on heuristic approaches, such as pricing at the inflection point, which prioritizes maximum price sensitivity but does not guarantee maximum revenue. This study proposes a novel, exact pricing algorithm that analytically derives the revenue-maximizing price under the logit demand function using the Lambert W function. By providing a closed-form solution, the approach eliminates reliance on heuristic iterative methods and corrects the common practice of considering the inflection point price as market price. In fact, we demonstrate that the optimal price is consistently lower than the inflection-point price under reasonable assumptions, leading to lower prices for consumers and higher revenue for sellers. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed algorithm and examine the changes in the optimality gap as demand function parameters vary. Results indicate that the optimal price is consistently lower than the inflection-point price, with an average 20% price reduction accompanied by a 15% increase in revenue.",

    "title": "Stability of knot equivalence at low regularity, and symmetric critical knots for the M\u00f6bius energy",
    "abstract": "We present sufficient criteria for the equivalence of tame knots at low regularity. To this end, we introduce a localized version of Gromov's distortion for any closed path-connected subset of $\\R^n$. If two such sets have local Gromov distortion below a universal dimension-dependent constant $g_n$ at some scale, and if their Hausdorff-distance is less than one quarter of that scale, we can show that the fundamental groups of their complements are isomorphic. In addition, we construct this isomorphism so that it restricts to the corresponding peripheral subgroups as an isomorphism as well.\n  Applied to the images of one-dimensional knots it follows that two knots are equivalent if their Hausdorff-distance is bounded in terms of the scale under which their local Gromov distortion is controlled. From that we deduce novel stability results for knot equivalence in the Lipschitz category, and in the setting of fractional Sobolev regularity below $C^1$. Moreover, we prove a compactness theorem of knot equivalence classes with respect to weak $W^{3/2,2}$-convergence.\n  As an application we show that the M\u00f6bius energy introduced by O'Hara~\\cite{ohara_1991a} can be minimized within arbitrary prime knot classes under a symmetry constraint, and that these minimizers are in fact critical points and therefore smooth and even real analytic. In particular, in every torus knot class there are at least two distinct critical knots for the M\u00f6bius energy.",

We show that if a vertex satisfies a certain degree condition, then some Hilbert coefficients remain unchanged upon its removal, thereby providing a reduction technique for computing Hilbert coefficients. As an application, for any $i\\geq 0$ and a pair $(r,s)$ with $r\\geq 2, s\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, we show that there always exists a graph $G$ such that $\\mathrm{reg}(S/J_G)=r$ and $e_i(S/J_G)=s$, where $\\mathrm{reg}(S/J_G)$ and $e_i(R/J_G)$ denote the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the $i$-th Hilbert coefficient of $S/J_G$, respectively. In particular, this demonstrates that there is no inherent relationship between the regularity and the Hilbert coefficients for the class of binomial edge ideals.",
