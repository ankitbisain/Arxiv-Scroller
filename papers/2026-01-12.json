In this paper, by constructing covering codes in the sum-rank metric from covering codes in the Hamming metric, we derive new upper bounds on sizes, the covering radii and the block length functions of codes in the sum-rank metric. As applications, we present several strong Singleton-like bounds that are tighter than the classical Singleton-like bound when block lengths are large. In addition, we give the explicit constructions of the distance-optimal sum-rank codes of matrix sizes $s\\times s$ and $2\\times 2$ with minimum sum-rank distance four respectively by using cyclic codes in the Hamming metric. More importantly, we present an infinite families of quasi-perfect $q$-ary sum-rank codes with matrix sizes $2\\times m$.

    "abstract": "We analyze the stability and dynamics of bistable planar fronts in multicomponent reaction-diffusion systems on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Under standard spectral stability assumptions, we establish Lyapunov stability of the front against fully nonlocalized perturbations. Such perturbations could previously be treated only for scalar equations via comparison principles. We also prove that the leading-order dynamics of the perturbed front are governed by a modulation that tracks the motion of the front interface and evolves according to a viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This effective description reveals that asymptotic orbital stability does not hold in general. However, asymptotic stability can be recovered by imposing localization of perturbations in the transverse spatial directions. The treatment of nonlocalized perturbations on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ poses significant challenges, both at the linear and nonlinear level. At the linear level, the neutral translational mode gives rise to continuous spectrum which touches the origin and cannot be projected out by conventional means, resulting in merely algebraic decay rates for the residual. Our linear estimates are necessarily $L^{\\infty}$-based, yielding significantly weaker decay rates than those available for $L^p$-localized perturbations. At the nonlinear level, quadratic gradient terms decay at a critical rate and cannot be treated perturbatively. We overcome these challenges by carefully decomposing the linearized dynamics, blending semigroup methods with ideas from the stability analysis of viscous shock waves, and introducing a novel nonlinear tracking scheme that combines spatiotemporal modulation with forcing techniques and the Cole-Hopf transform.",

In this paper, we develop the hypergraph obstruction concretely and give some homological obstructions for the k-regular embeddings of graphs by using the embedded homology of sub-hypergraphs of the (k-1)-skeleton of the independence complexes. Regular embeddings of graphs can be regarded equivalently as geometric realizations of the independence complexes and consequently be regarded equivalently as simplicial embeddings of the independence complexes into the vectorial matroids. We prove that if there exists a k-regular embedding of a graph, then there is an induced homomorphism from the embedded homology of the sub-hyper(di)graphs of the (k-1)-skeleton of the (directed) independence complexes to the homology of (directed) matroids. Moreover, if there exists certain triple of graphs where each graph has a k-regular embedding, then there are induced commutative diagrams of certain Mayer-Vietoris sequences of the embedded homology of hyper(di)graphs, the homology of (directed) independence complexes and the homology of matroids. Furthermore, if there exists certain couple of graphs where each graph has a k-regular embedding, then there are induced commutative diagrams of certain Kunneth type short exact sequences of the embedded homology of hyper(di)graphs, the homology of (directed) independence complexes and the homology of matroids.",

The stability near the interface is guaranteed by a local polynomial extension technique combined with ghost penalty bilinear forms, from which the robust condition number estimates and the error estimates are derived. Furthermore, the jump penalty term for weakly enforcing the jump condition in our method is also defined based on the local polynomial extension, which enables us to establish the error estimation particularly for solutions with low regularity.

Numerical methods for these models are challenged by increased stiffness for small scaling parameters and the necessity of asymptotics preservation regarding a parabolic limit equation. As a prototype model, we consider the telegraph equation in one spatial dimension subject to periodic boundary conditions with an asymptotic limit given by the linear heat equation. We provide a general semidiscrete stability result for this model when spatially discretized by arbitrary periodic (upwind) SBP operators and formally prove that the fully discrete scheme is asymptotic preserving. Moreover, we prove that DoD with central numerical fluxes leads to periodic SBP operators. Furthermore, we show that adapting the upwind DoD scheme yields periodic upwind SBP operators. Consequently, the DoD stabilization possesses the desired properties considered in the first part of this work and thus leads to a stable and asymptotic preserving scheme for the telegraph equation. We back our theoretical results with numerical simulations and demonstrate the applicability of this cut-cell stabilization for implicit time integration in the heat equation limit.",

Here we propose a natural intermediary problem where one considers the fractal surface generated by the graph of the additive Brownian sheet in $\\mathbb{R}^k$. We obtain the first non-trivial estimates in this direction, giving both a sufficient condition on the range of $q\\in[1,2]$ for the Fourier transform to be $L^{q}(\\mathbb{R}^{k+1})\\to L^2(G(W))$ bounded and a necessary condition for it to be $L^{q}(\\mathbb{R}^{k+1})\\to L^p(G(W))$ bounded. The sufficient condition is obtained via the Fourier spectrum, which is a family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. Our main technical result, which is of interest in its own right, gives a precise formula for the Fourier spectrum of the natural measure on the graph of the additive Brownian sheet, and we apply this result to the Fourier restriction problem. Our restriction estimate is stronger than the estimate obtained from the well-known Stein--Tomas restriction theorem for all $k\\geq3$.

    "abstract": "The concept of keplerian shear was introduced by Damien Thomine recently. It is useful for non ergodic systems, and can be seen as strong mixing conditionally on invariant fibers. The notion is particularly interesting when a.e. fiber is not strongly mixing.  We develop here an approach appropriate for systems such that a.e. fiber is weakly mixing, and apply it to a family of rank one transformations. Each transformation is a kind of Chacon map, built with a random number of spacers at each step of the Rochklin tower. We prove that this new dynamical system exhibits keplerian shear. The method relies on a version of a local limit theorem for time dependent Birkhoff sums along the fullshift.",

    "abstract": "The Hilbert transform is a multiplier operator and is widely used in the theory of Fourier transforms. The Hilbert transform was the motivation for the development of modern harmonic analysis. Its discrete version is also widely used in many areas of science and technology and plays an important role in digital signal processing. The essential motivation behind thinking about discrete transforms is that experimental data are most often not taken in a continuous manner but sampled at discrete time values. Since much of the data collected in both the physical sciences and engineering are discrete, the discrete Hilbert transform is a rather useful tool in these areas for the general analysis of this type of data. In this paper, we discuss the discrete Hilbert transform on discrete Weighted Morrey spaces and obtain its boundedness in these spaces.",

While this study has revealed fascinating phenomena in the context of Bernoulli percolation, few results have been obtained regarding other random spatial processes. In this paper we prove the first instance of noise sensitivity for a spatial growth process associated to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class of universality. More specifically, we show that travel times in geometric last-passage percolation are noise sensitive with respect to a perturbation acting on a Bernoulli encoding of the geometric weights. Our method of proof includes a generalisation of the celebrated Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm noise sensitivity/influence theorem, and precise bounds on the probability of a given vertex being on a geodesic, which we believe to be of independent interest.",

For single-antenna systems, two schemes are developed: symbol random mapping and symbol time diversity, enabling modulation order confusion with customized receivers. For multi-antenna systems, receiver-transparent MOC schemes are proposed, including series-expansion-based and constellation-path-based signal designs, and are further extended to RIS-assisted systems with joint beamformer and RIS reflection design. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes effectively defeat both deep-learning-based and expert-knowledge-based modulation classifiers without degrading communication performance.",

We show that every optimizer of the XGBoost objective is also an optimizer of an equivalent penalized regression problem over $\\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\\infty-\\text{ST}}$ with penalty $V^{d, s}_{\\infty-\\text{XGB}}(\\cdot)$, providing an interpretation of XGBoost as implicitly targeting a broader function class. We also develop a smoothness-based interpretation of $\\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\\infty-\\text{ST}}$ and $V^{d, s}_{\\infty-\\text{XGB}}(\\cdot)$ in terms of Hardy--Krause variation. We prove that the least squares estimator over $\\{f \\in \\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\\infty-\\text{ST}}: V^{d, s}_{\\infty-\\text{XGB}}(f) \\le V\\}$ achieves a nearly minimax-optimal rate of convergence $n^{-2/3} (\\log n)^{4(\\min(s, d) - 1)/3}$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality.

We analyze the performance of this strategy from a theoretical and practical viewpoint.

By virtue of a novel analytical technique, the boundedness of the numerical solution in the infinity norm is established, upon which the unconditionally optimal error estimates in the $L^2$ and $H^1$-norms are further derived. Compared with the space-time error splitting technique commonly adopted in the literature, the analytical method proposed in this paper does not require the introduction of an additional temporal discretization system, thus greatly simplifying the theoretical argument. The core point of the argument lies in the skillful application of the inverse inequality and discrete Agmon inequality to analyze the two cases, namely $\u03c4\\leq h$ and $\u03c4>h$, respectively. Three numerical examples covering both two- and three-dimensional scenarios are eventually provided for the validation of the theoretical findings.",

    "title": "On the Limits of Self-Improving in LLMs and Why AGI, ASI and the Singularity Are Not Near Without Symbolic Model Synthesis",
    "abstract": "We formalise recursive self-training in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI as a discrete-time dynamical system and prove that, as training data become increasingly self-generated ($\u03b1_t \\to 0$), the system undergoes inevitably degenerative dynamics. We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement.",

To achieve these goals, the indefinite linear quadratic (LQ)-optimal control problem is firstly discussed. By employing the bounded linear operator theory and the inner product, a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a linear state feedback LQ-optimal control law is derived, which is closely linked with the solvability of the backward Riccati operator equation with a sign condition. Based on this, stochastic bounded real lemma is set up to facilitate the $H_{\\infty}$ performance of the disturbed system in Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, the Nash equilibrium problem associated with two parameterized quadratic performance indices is worked out, which enables a uniform treatment of the $H_{\\infty}$ and $H_2/H_{\\infty}$ control designs by selecting specific values for the parameters. Several examples are supplied to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results, especially the practical significance in engineering applications.",

The methodology combines dynamic asset eligibility, deterministic rebalancing, and bounded multi-factor tilts applied to an equal-weight baseline. Asset eligibility is formalized as a state-dependent constraint on portfolio construction, allowing factor exposure to adjust endogenously in response to observable market conditions such as liquidity, volatility, and cross-sectional breadth. Rather than estimating expected returns or covariances, the framework relies on cross-sectional rankings and hard structural bounds to control concentration, turnover, and fragility. The resulting approach is fully algorithmic, transparent, and directly implementable. It provides a robustness-oriented alternative to parametric optimization and unconstrained multi-factor models, particularly suited for long-horizon allocations where stability and operational feasibility are primary objectives.",

However, complex phenomena in heterogeneous media often exhibit multi-scale memory effects and aging properties that classical operators cannot capture. In this work, we construct a unified framework by defining the \\textit{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators}. This formalism offers a fundamental generalization of fractional calculus, freeing the theory from the constraints of power-law memory (via Sonine kernels), time-translation invariance (via scale and weight functions), and artificial history truncation (via Weyl integration).\n  The main result is a Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem, proving that the Weighted Fourier Transform acts as a universal diagonalization map for these operators. We rigorously characterize the admissible memory kernels through the class of \\textit{Complete Bernstein Functions}, ensuring that the resulting operators preserve the fundamental properties of positivity and monotonicity. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical bridge between the algebraic Sonine definition and the analytical Marchaud representation involving L\u00e9vy measures.\n  Finally, we apply this theory to solve generalized relaxation equations and \\textit{Weighted Distributed Order} evolution problems, demonstrating that phenomena of ultra-slow diffusion and retarded aging can be treated explicitly within this unified spectral framework.",

    "abstract": "Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is a workhorse algorithm for discovering underlying low-dimensional structure in tensor data. This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data.",

We introduce fundamental concepts of shape sensitivity analysis and their numerical applications, mainly for educational purposes, while also emphasizing computational efficiency via parallelism for practitioners. We adopt an optimize-then-discretize strategy based on the distributed shape derivative and its tensor representation, following the approach of \\cite{MR3843884} and extending it in several directions. The numerical shape modeling relies on a level set method, whose evolution is driven by a descent direction computed from the shape derivative. Geometric constraints are treated accurately through a Proximal-Perturbed Lagrangian approach. FormOpt leverages the powerful features of FEniCSx, particularly its support for weak formulations of partial differential equations, diverse finite element types, and scalable parallelism. The implementation supports three different parallel computing modes: data parallelism, task parallelism, and a mixed mode. Data parallelism exploits FEniCSx's mesh partitioning features, and we implement a task parallelism mode which is useful for problems governed by a set of partial differential equations with varying parameters. The mixed mode conveniently combines both strategies to achieve efficient utilization of computational resources.",

More specifically, we consider a new formulation, namely the adversarial maximum clique problem, which extends the classical maximum-clique problem to graphs with edges strategically perturbed by an adversary. The proposed mathematical model is thus formulated as a two-player zero-sum game between a clique seeker and an opposing agent. Inspired by regularized continuous reformulations of the maximum-clique problem, we derive a penalized continuous formulation leading to a nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problem. We further introduce the notion of stable global solutions, namely points remaining optimal under small perturbations of the penalty parameters, and prove an equivalence between stable global solutions of the continuous reformulation and largest cliques that are common to all the adversarially perturbed graphs. In order to solve the given nonsmooth problem, we develop a first-order and projection-free algorithm based on generalized subdifferential calculus in the sense of Clarke and Goldstein, and establish global sublinear convergence rates for it. Finally, we report numerical experiments on benchmark instances showing that the proposed method efficiently detects large common cliques.",

    "abstract": "The phase field crystal (PFC) method is an efficient technique for simulating the evolution of crystalline microstructures at atomistic length scales and diffusive time scales. Due to the high-order derivatives (sixth-order) and the strongly nonlinear term (locally Lipschitz), developing high-order stable schemes and establishing corresponding error estimates is particularly challenging. In this study, we first establish a general framework for high-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge--Kutta methods that preserves the original energy dissipation for auxiliary models with globally Lipschitz truncations on the nonlinear term. By employing the Sobolev embedding theorem and Cauchy's interlace theorem, we demonstrate that the solutions of the auxiliary models are identical to the solutions of the original models without the globally Lipschitz property, provided that the free energy of the initial value is well-defined. Furthermore, we rigorously prove the uniform boundedness of the solution in the L-infinity norm and unconditional global-in-time stability. This allows for a straightforward framework to derive optimal arbitrarily high-order L-infinity error estimate without relying on the Lipschitz assumption. In particular, compared to existing literature, the argument for error estimation is presented in a much more simplified and elegant manner, without imposing any constraints on time-step size or mesh grid size. In fact, the reported framework, built upon the truncated auxiliary problem for the original model, can be directly extended to a wide range of gradient flows, including Allen--Cahn equations, nonlocal PFC models, and epitaxial thin film growth equations, providing unconditional energy dissipation without enforcing Lipschitz continuity. Finally, we present numerical examples to validate our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of capturing long-time dynamics.",

This formulation extends classical sociophysical Ising models by capturing the tension between internal conviction, social conformity, and neutrality. Focusing on highly symmetric grid networks and spatially structured hidden-preference patterns, we analyze the resulting low-temperature dynamics using the pathwise approach to metastability. We provide a complete characterization of stable and metastable configurations, identify the maximal stability level of the energy landscape, and derive sharp asymptotics for hitting and mixing times. A central technical contribution is a new family of isoperimetric inequalities for polyominoes on the torus, which emerge from a geometric representation of opinion clusters and play a key role in determining critical configurations and energy barriers. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of how spatial heterogeneity in hidden preferences qualitatively reshapes collective opinion transitions and illustrate the power of geometric and probabilistic methods in the study of complex interacting systems.",

We show that-under physically meaningful assumptions-such antenna architectures exhibit limited complexity, i.e., can be modeled by finite-rank operators using finitely many parameters. Furthermore, we construct a sequence of finite-rank operators whose approximation error decays super-exponentially once the operator rank exceeds an effective bandwidth associated with the antenna architecture and the analysis frequency. These results constitute a fundamental prerequisite for the efficient and accurate modeling of general antenna architectures on digital computing platforms.",

Originally discovered as a property of harmonic functions, Harnack inequalities have since been studied for solutions of wider classes of elliptic and parabolic problems. In this monograph, we take particular interest in deriving Harnack inequalities for solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. We focus on exploring the methods introduced by Li and Yau in the case of the linear heat equation and later extended to nonlinear problems by Auchmuty and Bao. Prior to presenting these results, we study a minimisation problem, which appears naturally in the proofs. After establishing a family of three general Harnack inequality results by Auchmuty and Bao, we investigate applications to deriving Harnack inequalities satisfied by solutions of the porous medium equation and weak solutions of the parabolic problem associated with the $p$-Laplace operator, which we refer to here as the $p$-diffusion equation. Finally, we demonstrate a common application of Harnack inequalities by proving the local space-time H\u00f6lder continuity of solutions to a class of linear evolution problems. The proof is based on methods introduced by Moser during his seminal work on Harnack inequalities during the 1960s. We conclude by suggesting potential opportunities for future work following on from the topics discussed here.",

In this regime, we establish tight or near-tight bounds on the maximum code size. In particular, we determine the exact optimal code sizes for $t=n-1$ and for $t=n-2$, develop a refined analysis for $t=n-3$, and derive a general recursive puncturing upper bound for $t=n-k$ via a reduction from parameters $(n,k)$ to $(n-1,k-1)$.\n  On the constructive side, we completely resolve the binary multiset model: for all $t\\ge1$ we determine $S_2(n,t)$ exactly and give an explicit optimal congruence-based construction. We then study single-deletion codes beyond the binary case, presenting general $q$-ary constructions and showing, via explicit small-parameter examples, that the natural modular construction need not be optimal for $q\\ge3$.

This problem can be formulated as the minimization of the trace of the solution of a Lyapunov equation whose coefficient matrix depends on $\u03bd$. For physical relevance, the damping coefficients must be nonnegative and the resulting system must be asymptotically stable. We identify conditions under which the system is never stable or may lose stability for certain choices of $\u03bd$. In the latter case, we propose replacing the constraint $\u03bd\\ge 0$ with $\u03bd\\ge d$, where $d$ is a nonzero nonnegative vector chosen to ensure stability.\n  We derive explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the objective function and show that the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker conditions are equivalent to the vanishing of a nonlinear residual function at an optimal solution. To compute such a solution, we propose a Barzilai--Borwein residual minimization algorithm (BBRMA), which is simple and efficient but not globally convergent, and a spectral projected gradient (SPG) method, which is globally convergent. By exploiting the structure of the problem, we show how to efficiently compute the objective function and its gradient, with eigenvalue decompositions constituting the dominant cost in terms of execution time. Numerical experiments show that both methods require fewer eigenvalue decompositions than the fast optimal damping algorithm (FODA), and that, although SPG may incur additional decompositions due to line search, it often converges faster than BBRMA, leading to a lower overall computational effort.",

    "abstract": "Modeling acoustic wave fields in microstructured elastic solids is discussed in the context of the Riemann-Cartan geometry. We consider a scenario where microstructural deformations occur much faster than those of the bulk material. This time-scale separation creates apparent geometric incompatibilities at the macroscopic level, even without any permanent inelastic deformation (at micro or macro-scale) or damage. We formalize this phenomenon using the concept of a non-holonomic tetrads to represent the macroscopic elastic deformations and the associated torsion field to characterize the resulting geometric incompatibilities. The spatial components of the torsion tensor quantify the instantaneous geometric incompatibility of the macroscopic elastic deformations, while its time components capture the inertial effects arising from the reversible energy exchange between the micro and macro scales. A key finding is that the model's dispersion relation predicts the existence of a complete frequency band gap. Furthermore, the governing equations exhibit a notable mathematical analogy to Maxwell's equations which can link the modeling of phononic and photonic metamaterials.",

We propose a family of compression schemes in which operators transform vectors fed to their input according to a Markov chain, i.e. the stochasticity of the compressors depends on previous iterations. The compressors are implemented in the vanilla Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm (QSGD), and, to further improve the efficiency and convergence rate, in the momentum accelerated QSGD. We provide convergence results for our algorithms with Markovian compressors, the analysis covers non-convex, Polyak-Lojasiewicz, and strongly convex cases. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach to distributed data-parallel optimization problems, we conduct experiments on the CIFAR-10 and GLUE datasets with the Resnet-18 and DeBERTaV3 models. Practical results show the superiority of methods that use our compressor design over existing schemes.",

    "abstract": "We analyze synchronization of relaxation oscillations in multiple-timescale reaction-diffusion systems. Interpreting synchronization as convergence to frequency-synchronized wave-train solutions, we resolve for the first time the case of phase waves. These waves are nearly phase-synchronized relaxation oscillations, featuring quasistationary plateaus of length $\\varepsilon^{-1}$ separated by fast transition layers, where $\\varepsilon\\ll1$ is the timescale separation parameter. Tracking the decay of modulations via a Bloch-wave eigenfunction analysis, we find a remarkably weak interaction strength of order $\\varepsilon^{8/3}$. This weak layer interaction and many of the technical difficulties arise from repeated scattering of eigenfunctions through fold points at the ends of the quasistationary plateaus. We capture this by combining a novel geometric desingularization approach with Lin's method, exponential trichotomies, and the Riccati transform. While our spectral stability analysis yields diffusive synchronization of all phase waves in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system, it also identifies potential finite-wavelength instabilities, which we realize in a system variant.",

The scheme can proactively avoid external interference and intra-system co-channel collisions, thereby improving covertness and reliability. Within this framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) of the eavesdropper and the reliable transmission probability (RTP) of legitimate users under multi-user joint detection. We then analytically optimize the transmission power that can maximize the covert rate (CR), as well as the maximum number of users that can access the system covertly and concurrently under given covertness and reliability constraints. Simulation results confirm the tight match between the analytical and Monte Carlo curves, and show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher DEP, a larger RTP, and a greater multi-user capacity than the benchmark scheme.",

    "title": "On the Effect of Misspecifying the Embedding Dimension in Low-rank Network Models",
    "abstract": "As network data has become ubiquitous in the sciences, there has been growing interest in network models whose structure is driven by latent node-level variables in a (typically low-dimensional) latent geometric space. These \"latent positions\" are often estimated via embeddings, whereby the nodes of a network are mapped to points in Euclidean space so that \"similar\" nodes are mapped to nearby points. Under certain model assumptions, these embeddings are consistent estimates of the latent positions, but most such results require that the embedding dimension be chosen correctly, typically equal to the dimension of the latent space. Methods for estimating this correct embedding dimension have been studied extensive in recent years, but there has been little work to date characterizing the behavior of embeddings when this embedding dimension is misspecified. In this work, we provide theoretical descriptions of the effects of misspecifying the embedding dimension of the adjacency spectral embedding under the random dot product graph, a class of latent space network models that includes a number of widely-used network models as special cases, including the stochastic blockmodel. We consider both the case in which the dimension is chosen too small, where we prove estimation error lower-bounds, and the case where the dimension is chosen too large, where we show that consistency still holds, albeit at a slower rate than when the embedding dimension is chosen correctly.A range of synthetic data experiments support our theoretical results. Our main technical result, which may be of independent interest, is a generalization of earlier work in random matrix theory, showing that all non-signal eigenvectors of a low-rank matrix subject to additive noise are delocalized.",

In each of the two settings, two circular signal distributions are considered: a hard-cluster distribution, where correlated planted observations lie in an arc of known length and unknown location, and a von Mises distribution, where correlated planted observations follow a von Mises distribution with a common unknown location parameter.

We further generalize the argument to non-tracial $\u03c3$-finite von Neumann algebras under the weaker assumption of GNS-detailed balance, using Haagerup's reduction and Kosaki's interpolation theorem.

We study these two parameters in two commonly considered models of random preferential attachment graphs, with $h \\geq 2$ edges added per step.

As a consequence, we recover and refine known results on the Hausdorff dimension of sets defined by a prescribed asymptotic arithmetic mean of the continued fraction digits. Finally, we relate the Lyapunov exponent to the exponential rate of convergence of rational approximations arising from truncations of the Schneider continued fraction expansion. This provides a $p$-adic analogue of classical results from Diophantine approximation and yielding precise dimension formulas for the associated level sets.",

The limiting process captures essential behavioral features of the underlying stochastic dynamics, including goal-directed motion, inter-agent repulsion, and reflection at domain boundaries. This result provides a rigorous analytical framework for approximating constrained queueing networks and crowd motion models, offering tractable characterizations of their steady-state behavior and transient dynamics under large-scale regimes. We further illustrate the theoretical findings through two numerical examples. The first example considers a crowd dynamics scenario, modeling interacting agents navigating within a confined domain, while the second focuses on a neural population model that describes stochastic activity evolution under competition and bounded constraints. These experiments validate the convergence predicted by the diffusion approximation and demonstrate how discrete stochastic systems with reflection and interaction mechanisms approach their continuous reflected OU limits, offering both physical and biosocial interpretations of the theory.",

Such systems are used in the modelling of single-cell chemotaxis, where the contour of the cell shape corresponds to a level set of the phase-field. The technical challenge lies in the singularities at zero level sets of the phase-field.

    "abstract": "Sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design (SBOED) for PDE-governed inverse problems is computationally challenging, especially for infinite-dimensional random field parameters. High-fidelity approaches require repeated forward and adjoint PDE solves inside nested Bayesian inversion and design loops. We formulate SBOED as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and learn an amortized design policy via policy-gradient reinforcement learning (PGRL), enabling online design selection from the experiment history without repeatedly solving an SBOED optimization problem. To make policy training and reward evaluation scalable, we combine dual dimension reduction -- active subspace projection for the parameter and principal component analysis for the state -- with an adjusted derivative-informed latent attention neural operator (LANO) surrogate that predicts both the parameter-to-solution map and its Jacobian. We use a Laplace-based D-optimality reward while noting that, in general, other expected-information-gain utilities such as KL divergence can also be used within the same framework. We further introduce an eigenvalue-based evaluation strategy that uses prior samples as proxies for maximum a posteriori (MAP) points, avoiding repeated MAP solves while retaining accurate information-gain estimates. Numerical experiments on sequential multi-sensor placement for contaminant source tracking demonstrate approximately $100\\times$ speedup over high-fidelity finite element methods, improved performance over random sensor placements, and physically interpretable policies that discover an ``upstream'' tracking strategy.",

    "title": "Age of Gossip With Cellular Drone Mobility",
    "abstract": "We consider a cellular network containing $n$ nodes where nodes within a cell gossip with each other in a fully-connected fashion and a source shares updates with these nodes via a mobile drone. The mobile drone receives updates directly from the source and shares them with nodes in the cell where it currently resides. The drone moves between cells according to an underlying continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of cells $f(n)$, drone speed $\u03bb_m(n)$ and drone dissemination rate $\u03bb_d(n)$ on the freshness of information of nodes in the network. We utilize the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information. We observe that the expected duration between two drone-to-cell service times depends on the stationary distribution of the underlying CTMC and $\u03bb_d(n)$, but not on $\u03bb_m(n)$. However, the version age instability in slow moving CTMCs makes high probability analysis for a general underlying CTMC difficult. Therefore, next we focus on the fully-connected drone mobility model. Under this model, we uncover a dual-bottleneck between drone mobility and drone dissemination speed: the version age is constrained by the slower of these two processes. If $\u03bb_d(n) \\gg \u03bb_m(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\u03bb_m(n)$ and is independent of $\u03bb_d(n)$. If $\u03bb_m(n) \\gg \u03bb_d(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\u03bb_d(n)$ and is independent of $\u03bb_m(n)$.",

In this article, we continue to study this problem by considering the intersections with the algebraic subgroups of the CM fibers, generalizing a previous result of Barroero for fibered powers of elliptic schemes. A key ingredient of the proof is an explicit control of canonical heights under endomorphisms: for an abelian variety $A/\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$, an ample symmetric divisor $D$, and $f \\in \\mathrm{End}(A)$, we bound explicitly $\\widehat{h}_{A, D}(f(P))$ in terms of $\\widehat{h}_{A, D}(P)$ by determining the values of $\u03bb\\in \\mathbb{R}$ for which the divisors $\u03bbD - f^* D$ and $f^* D - \u03bbD$ are ample.",

Assuming that the function is decomposed into an arbitrary subfunction set $\\mathbf{X}$, with each subfunction depending on $d$ input files, renders our distributed computing problem into a $d$-uniform hypergraph edge partitioning problem wherein the edge set (subfunction set), defined by $d$-wise dependencies between vertices (files) must be partitioned across $N$ disjoint groups (workers). The aim is to design a file and subfunction allocation, corresponding to a partition of $\\mathbf{X}$, that minimizes the communication cost $\u03c0_{\\mathbf{X}}$, representing the maximum number of distinct files per server, while also minimizing the computation cost $\u03b4_{\\mathbf{X}}$ corresponding to a maximal worker subfunction load. For a broad range of parameters, we propose a deterministic allocation solution, the \\emph{Interweaved-Cliques (IC) design}, whose information-theoretic-inspired interweaved clique structure simultaneously achieves order-optimal communication and computation costs, for a large class of decompositions $\\mathbf{X}$. This optimality is derived from our achievability and converse bounds, which reveal -- under reasonable assumptions on the density of $\\mathbf{X}$ -- that the optimal scaling of the communication cost takes the form $n/N^{1/d}$, revealing that our design achieves the order-optimal \\textit{partitioning gain} that scales as $N^{1/d}$, while also achieving an order-optimal computation cost.
