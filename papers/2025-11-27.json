Among the various particular regimes, each determined by the values of the parameters $(a, b, c, d)$ appearing in the equations, the \\emph{generic} regime is characterized by the conditions $b, d > 0$ and $a, c < 0$. If additionally $b=d$, the $abcd$ system is Hamiltonian.\n  In this paper, we investigate the existence of generalized solitary waves and the corresponding collision problem in the physically relevant \\emph{variable bottom regime}, introduced by M.\\ Chen. More precisely, the bottom is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function $h=\\varepsilon h_0(\\varepsilon t,\\varepsilon x)$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a small parameter and $h_0$ is a fixed smooth profile. This formulation allows for a detailed description of weak long-range interactions and the evolution of the solitary wave without its destruction.

By extending sheaf-theoretic and homological tools to the non-commutative Gamma-spectrum Spec_Gamma^nc(T), we obtain a coherent framework of non-commutative derived Gamma-geometry that parallels the classical paradigms of Grothendieck and Kontsevich in homological algebra and non-commutative geometry.

    "abstract": "In energy science, Darcy flow in heterogeneous porous media is a central problem in reservoir sim-ulation. However, the pronounced multiscale characteristics of such media pose significant challenges to conventional numerical methods in terms of computational demand and efficiency. The Mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MGMsFEM) provides an effective framework for addressing these challenges, yet the construction of multiscale basis functions remains computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a dual-domain deep learning framework to accelerate the computation of multiscale basis functions within MGMsFEM for solving Darcy flow problems. By extracting and decoding permeability field features in both the frequency and spatial domains, the method enables rapid generation of numerical matrices of multiscale basis functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant computational acceleration while maintaining high approximation accuracy, thereby offering the potential for future applications in real-world reservoir engineering.",

    "title": "A Modified BGK Collision Operator for Exact Conservation in Numerical Solutions of Boltzmann-BGK",
    "abstract": "Ideal gases can be modeled by the Boltzmann equation from statistical physics. Instead of trying to track the position and velocity of a large number of gas molecules, it is possible to describe the particles with a particle distribution function. The Boltzmann equation provides the rule for evolving the distribution function over time, allowing one to simulate the gas dynamics. In this work, we develop a novel numerical method for solving the 1D1V Boltzmann-BGK equation. Several important ingredients are combined to create an accurate, efficient, robust numerical method valid in all flow regimes. First, we make use of operator splitting to create separate transport and collision sub-steps, each of which is easier to discretize than the whole system; second, we introduce a third-order accurate Lax-Wendroff-type scheme for the transport sub-step; third, we make use of the second-order L-stable TR-BDF method for the collision sub-step. The final component we introduce is a novel treatment of the collision sub-step to guarantee that the total mass, momentum, and energy are conserved even in the presence of a truncated velocity range and quadrature errors in computing moments. The key idea is to multiply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the collision sub-step by a quadratic Hermite polynomial, where the coefficients in the polynomial are chosen to ensure exact conservation. The resulting scheme is verified on piecewise constant initial data with periodic boundary conditions; exact conservation up to machine precision is demonstrated for mass, momentum, and energy. The resulting method is implemented in a freely available Java code with Python plotting routines.",

While Gaussian process (GP) frameworks are increasingly used for fluid dynamics, their priors are often chosen for convenience rather than being rigorously justified by the system's long-term dynamics.\n  In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a probabilistic framework for 2D SNS built directly upon this theoretical foundation. We construct our GP prior precisely from the stationary covariance of the linear OU model, which is explicitly defined by the forcing spectrum and dissipation. This provides a principled, GP prior with rigorous long-time dynamical justification for turbulent flows, bridging SPDE theory and practical data assimilation.",

It operates in a fully behavioral manner, relying solely on the current trajectory and pre-collected input-output data, without requiring explicit identification of system parameters. We refer to this model as a behavioral Conditional Generative Model (CGM). We prove the convergence of the distribution of samples generated by the CGM as the size of the trajectory library increases, with an explicit characterization of the convergence rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the gap between the asymptotic distribution of the proposed CGM and the true posterior distribution obtained by Kalman filter, which leverages the knowledge of all system parameters and all historical data, decreases exponentially with respect to the length of past samples. Finally, we integrate this generative model into predictive controllers for stochastic LTI systems. Numerical results verify the derived bounds and demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller equipped with the proposed behavioral CGM.",

    "abstract": "We study the existence of polychromatic solutions of cubically nonlinear Maxwell equations in the whole space and with dispersive media, i.e., with a time delayed polarization. Due to the complex nature of the dielectric function, the frequencies are complex, resulting in a decay in time. The geometry is that of a waveguide in $x$ with the propagation direction being $y$ and the solutions are localized in $x$ and TM-polarized. These are often referred to as breathers. They are given as a Fourier series in $y$ and $t$ with the leading frequency $\u03c9$ being an eigenvalue of a corresponding operator pencil on $\\mathbb{R}$ (in the $x$ variable). Each term in the series corresponds to a different temporal decay rate or a different frequency. The series is constructed iteratively via a sequence of linear ordinary differential equations. Our general result provides the existence under some assumptions on the spectrum and on estimates of the resolvent of the corresponding linear operator. We also produce an example of a waveguide given by the interface of two spatially homogeneous physically relevant media for which these assumptions are satisfied. For such an interface setting the constructed solutions correspond to nonlinear polychromatic surface plasmons.",

    "title": "Lopsided HSS Iterative Method and Preconditioner for a class of Complex Symmetric Linear System",
    "abstract": "In this study, we propose the lopsided HSS (LHSS) iteration method for solving a class of complex symmetric indefinite systems of linear equations. This method employs an alternating iterative scheme, where each iteration entails solving two systems of equations with symmetric real coefficient matrices. This design is intended to reduce the high computational costs associated with complex arithmetic. Theoretical analysis shows that the upper bound of the convergence rate depends only on the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrices, as well as the iteration parameters. When the eigenvalues satisfy certain conditions, the method guarantees convergence for any positive iteration parameter. Building on this insight, we developed the preconditioned lopsided HSS iteration method (PLHSS). Theoretical results demonstrate that PLHSS exhibits superior convergence properties compared to the original method. Additionally, we derived the optimal parameters for the new approaches and corresponding optimal convergence rate. Furthermore, we derive the PLHSS preconditioner on the basis of the iterative method. The eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are well-clustered, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal with a specific inner product. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the preconditioned GMRES and COCG methods. LHSS iteration methods and the relevant preconditioners show mesh size independent and parameter-insensitive convergence behavior for the test numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "A combinatorial game is a two-player game without hidden information or chance elements. The main object of combinatorial game theory is to obtain the outcome, which player has a winning strategy, of a given combinatorial game. Positions of many well-known combinatorial games are naturally decomposed into a disjunctive sum of multiple components and can be analyzed independently for each component. Therefore, the study of disjunctive sums is a major topic in combinatorial game theory. Combinatorial games in which both players have the same set of possible moves for every position are called impartial games. In the normal-play convention, it is known that the outcome of a disjunctive sum of impartial games can be obtained by computing the Grundy number of each term. The theory of impartial games is generalized in various forms. This paper proposes another generalization of impartial games to a new framework, impartial games with activeness: each game is assigned a status of either ``active'' or ``inactive''; the status may change by moves; a disjunctive sum of games ends immediately, not only when no further moves can be made, but also when all terms become inactive. We formally introduce impartial games with activeness and investigate their fundamental properties.",

We find a large class of Wilf-Equivalences between $k+1$ classes of $k$ patterns of length $k+1$, and outline several classes of unbalanced Wilf-Equivalences related to the first class.

We show that, unlike the case for invariant means, every group admits a CCM and give two constructions -- one via the Ultrafilter Lemma and one via the Hahn--Banach Theorem -- both relying on a Theorem of B. H. Neumann. Using CCMs, we define a degree of commutativity for arbitrary groups, measuring the ``probability'' that two random elements of a group commute. We prove that this degree of commutativity is independent of the choice of CCM and is positive precisely for finite-by-abelian-by-finite groups, recovering and unifying previous characterisations.\n  We also introduce a defect function that quantifies the failure of left invariance for finitely additive means, and define the defect of a group as the infimum of these. We then prove a dichotomy: the defect for a group is either 0 or 1, with 0 characterising amenable groups.",

In particular, due to the fact that these two families are asymptotically identically distributed, large cycles formed in case (b) by chains of small Brownian loops (i.e., all of diameter much smaller than $N$) will look like large Brownian loops themselves, and form a second independent \"ghost\" critical loop-soup in the scaling limit. Reformulated in terms of the Gaussian free field on such cable-graphs, this shows that large cycles in the collection of its sign clusters will converge in the scaling limit to a Brownian loop-soup with twice the usual critical intensity. This result had been conjectured by the first author in arXiv:2209.07901 [math.PR] ; our proof builds heavily on the second author's switching property for such loop-soups from arXiv:2502.06754 [math.PR] .",

Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces.

For the Robin Laplacian, Payne and Schaefer (2001) formulated an analogous conjecture, positing that the ratio $\u03bc_2/\u03bc_1$ is also maximized by a disk for a range of the boundary parameter $\u03c3$. This was later restated by Henrot in 2003. In this work, we affirm this conjecture for all dimensions $N\\geq2$ and for all $\u03c3$ greater than or equal to a critical positive value $\u03c3_*$ which may depend on $\u03a9$. Furthermore, we prove that the maximum value of $\u03bc_2/\u03bc_1$ is strictly decreasing in $\u03c3$ over the entire interval $(0,+\\infty)$. Our result provides a positive answer to a variant of Yau's Problem 77: by measuring the ratio of the first two eigenfrequencies, one can determine whether an elastically supported drum is circular.",

Unlike adversarial distribution shift frameworks that yield conservative worst-case guarantees, RUPs induce dataset-level variance inflation rather than systematic bias. We provide examples of RUPs and show that this distributional uncertainty reduces the effective sample size to $n_{\\mathrm{eff}} = n/(1 + n \u03c4)$, where $\u03c4\\in [0,1]$ quantifies the perturbation strength. For local polynomial estimators, we derive an extended bias-variance decomposition that includes a distributional variance term with the same bandwidth scaling as classical sampling variance. This leads to a modified bandwidth selection principle: when distributional uncertainty dominates sampling uncertainty ($\u03c4\\gg 1/n$), optimal bandwidths scale as $\u03c4^{1/(2\u03b2+1)}$ rather than the usual $n^{-1/(2\u03b2+1)}$, where $\u03b2$ indicates the smoothness of the function class considered. We also establish matching minimax lower bounds showing that there exists an RUP for which this effective sample size $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is fundamental. Our results demonstrate that random dataset-level perturbations create a distinct mode of uncertainty that affects both practical tuning and fundamental statistical limits.",

    "abstract": "The transition mechanism from laminar flow to turbulent flow is a central problem in hydrodynamic stability theory. To shed light on this transition mechanism, Trefethen et al.({\\it \\small Science 1993}) proposed the transition threshold problem, aiming to quantify the magnitude of perturbations required to trigger instability and determine their scaling with the Reynolds number. In this paper, we investigate the transition threshold of Couette flow for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system in the high Reynolds number regime ($\\mathrm{Re}\\gg 1$). By exploiting the combined effects of rotation (dispersion) and mixing mechanisms, we derive an improved stability threshold scaling in $\\mathrm{Re}$. Precisely, we show that if the initial perturbation satisfies $$\\|v_{in}-(y, 0, 0)\\|_{\\tilde{H}(\\mathbb T \\times \\mathbb D)}\\leq \u03b5_0 \\,\\mathrm{Re}^{-\u03b1},$$ with any $\u03b1>\\frac 23$ and $\\tilde{H}=H^6 \\cap W^{3,1}$ for $\\mathbb D=\\mathbb{R}^2$, and with any $\u03b1\\geq\\frac 56$ and $\\tilde{H}=H^6$ for $\\mathbb D=\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{T}$, the corresponding solution of the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system exists globally in time and remains asymptotically close to the Couette flow. The main analytical challenge arises from the anisotropic nature of the estimates for the zero modes and from the interactions between zero and non-zero modes, which we address using an anisotropic Sobolev space directly tailored to the zero modes. Additionally, we introduce a new dispersive structure for the zero modes and derive suitable Strichartz-type estimates. These tools enable us to exploit both the nonlinear structure and the improved dispersive behavior of certain good components of the zero modes, which play a crucial role in achieving the improved stability threshold.",

    "abstract": "In 1973, Jim Wiegold introduced the concept of pseudocentre P(G) of a group G as the intersection of the normal closures of the centralizers of its elements. He proved that the pseudocentre of a non-trivial finite group is always non-trivial, giving a new variable on which one can use induction in finite group theory. In the same paper, Wiegold states that no obvious relations seem to hold between the pseudocentre and the canonical characteristic subgroups of a group.\n  The aim of this work is to show that the pseudocentre is indeed much more involved in the structure of an arbitrary group then anyone could have expected. For example, we prove that a soluble group coincides with its pseudocentre if and only if it is abelian, and that the structure of the commutator subgroup strongly influences the structure of the pseudocentre. And this is not the end of the story. In fact, the behaviour of the pseudocentre in arbitrary (possibly infinite) groups can be extremely wild: sometimes it is very difficult even to understand whether the pseudocentre is trivial or not. This wilderness is exampled by some of our main results (see the introduction for a complete list):\n  1) There exists a polycyclic group of Hirsch length 3 in which the pseudocentre is trivial. 2) The pseudocentre of the group of unitriangular matrices over any field is the largest term of the upper central series that is abelian. 3) Free products have a trivial pseudocentre, but there exist amalgamated free products of non-trivial groups coinciding with their pseudocentre. 4) Weakly regular branch groups have a trivial pseudocentre. 5) The pseudocentre of the Thompson group is the derived subgroup. 6) Wreath products can have a totally arbitrary pseudocentre.",

It is also completely integrable, belonging to the same hierarchy as the defocusing Davey-Stewartson II (DS II) system.\n  The mNV system is $L^2$ critical. Some time ago, Schottdorf proved that for small $L^2$ initial data, the mNV equation is globally well-posed. In this article, we consider instead the large data problem, using inverse scattering methods. Our main result asserts that the mNV system is globally well-posed for large $L^2$ data, with the solutions scattering as time goes to $\\pm \\infty$. One key ingredient in the proof, which is of independent interest, is a new nonlinear Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality for the associated scattering transform.\n  As a byproduct of our main result, we are also able to prove a global well-posedness result for the closely related Novikov-Veselov problem at the critical $\\dot H^{-1} + L^1$ level, for a range of data which can heuristically be described as soliton-free. Here we use the associated Miura map to connect the mNV and the NV flows. In order to characterize the range of the Miura map, we prove another result of independent interest, namely a sharp, scale invariant form of the Agmon-Allegretto-Piepenbrink principle in the critical case of two space dimensions.",

For the case where the distance function is convex, we propose an exact algorithm for solving this problem in time $O(n^3|P|^3)$, where $P$ is the set of possible prices and $n$ is the number of time slots.

We use this framework to give the first direct proof of $\\mathrm{BPI}$ in the generalized Cohen model $N(I,Q)$ -- a model that adds a Dedekind-finite set of mutually $Q$-generic filters over a ground model $M\\vDash\\mathrm{ZFC}$. In the case that the index set $I$ is large, we adapt Harrington's proof of the Halpern-L\u00e4uchli theorem to prove the result. We then extend the results from Karagila and Schlicht to show that $I$ can be assumed to be large without loss of generality. The approach given by Harrington's proof is essentially dynamical, and we show that this technique can be used in permutation models to reprove a direction of Blass' theorem: that a dynamical condition called the Ramsey property is sufficient for $\\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a permutation model. We then introduce a dynamical generalization of the Ramsey property called the virtual Ramsey property, which abstracts core features of our adaptation of Harrington's proof, and we prove that the virtual Ramsey property is sufficient for $\\mathrm{BPI}$ to hold in a symmetric extension.",

    "abstract": "Designing optimal controllers for nonlinear dynamical systems often relies on reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to approximate solutions of the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation. However, these methods require iterative training and depend on an initially admissible policy. This work introduces a new analytical framework that yields closed-form solutions to the HJB equation for a class of continuous-time nonlinear input-affine systems with known dynamics. Unlike ADP-based approaches, it avoids iterative learning and numerical approximation. Lyapunov theory is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the resulting closed-loop system, and theoretical guarantees are provided. The method offers a closed-form control policy derived from the HJB framework, demonstrating improved computational efficiency and optimal performance on state-of-the-art optimal control problems in the literature.",

He verified in small cases that their coefficients can be expressed in terms of certain $q$-zeta values and that the polynomials recover the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces studied by Mirzakhani under a certain $q \\to 1$ limit. In this paper, we provide mathematically rigorous proofs of these two phenomena. The authors previously defined natural $q$-deformations of the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of curves. We prove that these polynomials appear as the top degree part of Okuyama's polynomials. Our work provides a link between the two topics of the title, which hints at a ``quantum'' Weil-Petersson geometry and a combinatorial-geometric approach to double-scaled SYK correlators.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic iterative methods are useful in a variety of large-scale numerical linear algebraic, machine learning, and statistical problems, in part due to their low-memory footprint. They are frequently used in a variety of applications, and thus it is imperative to have a thorough theoretical understanding of their behavior. Most theoretical convergence results for stochastic iterative methods provide bounds on the expected error of the iterates, and yield a type of average case analysis. However, understanding the behavior of these methods in the near-worst-case is desirable. For stochastic methods, this motivates providing bounds on the variance and concentration of their error, which can be used to generate confidence intervals around the bounds on their expected error.\n  Here, we provide upper bounds for the concentration and variance of the error of a general class of linear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method and the randomized Gauss--Seidel method, and a more general class of nonlinear stochastic iterative methods, including the randomized Kaczmarz method for systems of linear inequalities.",

    "abstract": "High-fidelity numerical simulation serves as a cornerstone for exploring magnetization dynamics in micromagnetics. This work introduces a novel third-order temporally accurate and stable numerical scheme for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, aiming to address the limitations in accuracy and efficiency often encountered with conventional approaches. Validation via nanostrip simulations confirms two principal advantages of the proposed method: it attains strict third-order temporal accuracy, surpassing many current techniques, and it offers superior computational efficiency, enabling rapid convergence without sacrificing numerical precision. For Gilbert damping coefficients $\u03b1$ ranging from $0.1$ to values below $10$, the scheme preserves strong stability and effectively avoids non-physical magnetization states. The magnetic microstructures predicted by this method are in excellent agreement with those from established benchmark methods, affirming its reliability for quantitative physical analysis. Salient distinctions between the proposed scheme and an existing third-order semi-implicit method include:\n  (1) Solving the linear system associated with the existing scheme demands substantially greater computational time, underscoring the need for highly efficient solvers;\n  (2) Although the proposed method shows increased sensitivity to damping parameters, it reliably converges to stable physical states and is effective in simulating magnetic domain wall motion, producing outcomes consistent with prior validated studies;\n  (3) The energy levels computed by the proposed method are significantly lower than those obtained via the existing third-order scheme.",

    "abstract": "We establish sharp stability results for of non--selfadjoint the ascent and descent spectra under strong resolvent convergence (SRS), a natural framework for finite element approximations of non-selfadjoint and singularly perturbed operators. The key quantitative hypothesis is the reduced minimum modulus $\u03b3(T-\u03bb)>0$, which guarantees closed range and enables the transfer of the Kaashoek -- Taylor criteria via gap convergence of operator graphs. At the essential level, B--Fredholm theory extends stability to powers $(T-\u03bb)^m$ provided $\u03b3((T-\u03bb)^j)>0$ for all $1\\le j\\le m$. We introduce a computable finite-element diagnostic $\u03b3_h = \u03c3_{\\min}(M^{-1/2}(A_h-\u03bbM)M^{-1/2})$, which serves as a practical surrogate for $\u03b3(T-\u03bb)$ and remains uniformly positive even in convection-dominated regimes when stabilized schemes (e.g., SUPG) are employed. Numerical experiments confirm that $\\liminf_{h\\to0}\u03b3_h>0$ is both necessary and sufficient for spectral stability, while a Volterra-type counterexample demonstrates the indispensability of the closed-range condition for powers. The analysis clarifies why norm resolvent convergence fails for rough or singular limits, and how SRS-combined with quantitative control of $\u03b3_h$--rescues ascent--descent stability in realistic computational settings.",

The existence of minimizers to the resulting optimal control problem, which is constrained by a modified steady-state Poisson--Nernst--Planck system describing ionic electrodiffusion, has been theoretically established by using the direct method in the calculus of variation. Sensitivity analysis of the topology optimization model is performed to derive variational derivatives and corresponding adjoint equations. A gradient flow formulation discretized by a stabilized semi-implicit scheme is developed to solve the resulting topology optimization problem. Extensive numerical experiments present various porous electrode structures that own large area of electrode-electrolyte interface, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed topology optimization model and corresponding algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Isogeometric analysis (IgA) offers enhanced approximation capabilities for the discretization of elliptic boundary-value problems, yet it results in large, sparse, and increasingly ill-conditioned linear systems due to higher interconnectivity among degrees of freedom. In particular, the discretization with tensor-product B-splines or NURBS of degree $p$ on a mesh with $n$ elements per parametric direction leads to symmetric positive-definite systems of the form $K\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{F}$, where the matrix bandwidth and condition number scale unfavorably with both $p$ and spatial dimension $d$. To address the computational challenges posed by such systems, especially in three-dimensional or high-order scenarios, Krylov subspace methods with specialized preconditioners become essential. This paper investigates the efficacy of algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioners tailored for IgA-based discretizations, with a focus on performance in modern high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Leveraging the Parallel Sparse Computation Toolkit (PSCToolkit), we explore distributed-memory and GPU-accelerated strategies for solving large-scale problems. The study assesses algorithmic efficiency and scalability across a range of benchmark tests. The results demonstrate that AMG preconditioners can achieve robust and scalable performance, confirming their potential as practical solvers for large IgA systems in engineering and scientific applications.",

Motivated by recent work suggesting a Markovian structure in the vertical profile of such trees, we introduce the vertical edge profile, which counts both oriented edges connecting label $k-1$ to label $k$ and oriented edges connecting label $k$ to label $k-1$.\n  We show that the vertical edge profile forms a time-homogeneous Markov chain for a wide class of models, and this remains true (provided we enrich this process by the total mass of the tree below each label) if we condition on the total size of the tree. We give explicit transition kernels in the case of labelled incomplete binary trees, which are closely related to known enumeration formulas. To establish these results, we study a decomposition of labelled trees into excursions above and below fixed label levels, yielding a forest structure with tractable probabilistic laws.\n  We further explain briefly how these findings connect to the theory of super-Brownian motion and the Integrated Super-Brownian Excursion (ISE). In a companion paper, we show that the vertical edge profile converges, after rescaling,to the local time and its derivative of Brownian motion indexed by the Brownian tree.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a comprehensive Hamilton-Jacobi framework to analyze asymptotic propagation dynamics in a field-road system featuring unidirectional advection and Wentzell-type boundary conditions. We rigorously derive a Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequality as the singular limit of a reaction-diffusion system in the upper half-plane, where the road is modeled as a degenerate one-dimensional medium with enhanced diffusion and tangential drift. By synthesizing viscosity solution theory, optimal control formulation, and variational analysis, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and explicit variational representation of the viscosity solution. The solution is characterized by a fundamental solution constructed via optimal paths, revealing a critical transition in propagation behavior governed by a geometrically derived curve that separates rectilinear and road-assisted regimes. Our framework extends to non-order-preserving systems where classical comparison methods fail, and we provide a detailed asymptotic derivation of the Wentzell boundary condition from flux continuity principles. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to conical domains with intersecting roads, demonstrating the robustness of our variational methodology. Numerical simulations illustrate how advection and diffusion parameters shape the invaded region, highlighting the interplay between field and road dynamics in determining propagation patterns.",

In our framework, the proof of existence is far from trivial since the solution sought cannot be bounded. Consequently, the Anzellotti theory of pairings does not apply and we have to use new developments to introduce the meaning of solution.

The key step in both the free and $q$-Gaussian settings is a polarization identity for fourth cumulants of sums which holds only when the two terms have differing parities. These results are analogous to the recent preprint Fourth-Moment Theorems for Sums of Multiple Integrals by Basse-O'Connor, Kramer-Bang, and Svedsen in the classical Wiener-It\u00f4 chaos setting.",

The question of determining $e(n,s)$ is closely connected to its uniform counterpart, the subject of the famous Erd\u0151s Matching Conjecture.\n  The problem of determining $e(n,s)$ has proven to be very hard and, in spite of some progress during these years, even a general conjecture concerning the value of $e(n,s)$ is missing.

In this regime, the average size of a set in an $s$-matching is at most $3$, and it is a delicate interplay between the `missing' $2$- and $3$-element sets that plays a key role here.

With $M$ sources temporally discretized by $N_t$ time steps of size $\u0394t$, a naive potential evaluation at $M$ targets on the same time grid requires $\\mathcal O(M^2 N_t)$ work. Our scheme requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left((M + N^3\\log N)N_t\\right)$ work, where $N$ scales as $\\mathcal O(1/\u0394t)$, i.e., the maximum signal frequency. This is achieved by using the recently-proposed windowed Fourier projection (WFP) method to split the potential into a local part, evaluated directly, plus a smooth history part approximated by an $N^3$-point equispaced discretization of the Fourier transform, where each Fourier coefficient obeys a simple recursion relation. The growing oscillations in the spectral representation (which would be present with a naive use of the Fourier transform) are controlled by spatially truncating the hyperbolic Green's function itself. Thus, the method avoids the need for absorbing boundary conditions. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with up to a million sources and targets at 6-digit accuracy.

In particular, we show that if $G_1$ and $G_2$ have property (VRC) (that is, every cyclic subgroup is a virtual retract), then the same is true for $G$. We also prove that $G$ inherits some residual properties (such as residual finiteness or virtual residual solvability) from the factors $G_i$, provided $G_0$ is a virtual retract of $G_i$, for $i=1,2$.\n  Finally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for $G$ to be (virtually) $F_m$-fibered. In particular, we fully characterize when an amalgamated product of two (finitely generated free)-by-cyclic groups over a cyclic subgroup is free-by-cyclic or virtually free-by-cyclic.",

It turns out that the automorphism groups of one-point algebraic geometry codes agree with that of the Abd\u00f3n--Torres function field except for the trivial cases.

Specifically, we focus on {non-renormalizable} (in the sense of Douady and Hubbard) complex polynomials of degree $d \\geqslant 2$ that possess a Siegel disk of bounded type rotation number. We refer to such maps as {atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type}. In this setting, our main results are: (A) Atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type have locally connected Julia sets; (B) these Julia sets are quasiconformally rigid, i.e., they do not support invariant line fields; (C) any two combinatorially equivalent atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type coincide up to an affine change of coordinates. In particular, item (C) verifies the notorious {Combinatorial Rigidity Conjecture} for atomic Siegel polynomials of bounded type and arbitrary degree. By bringing neutral Siegel dynamics into the picture, we extend the celebrated higher-degree rigidity theorems of Avila--Kahn--Lyubich--Shen and Kozlovski--van Strien, which until now applied only in the Yoccoz setting, i.e., for finitely many times renormalizable polynomials without irrationally indifferent periodic points.",

Moreover, we provide detailed analysis of the convergence of these Krylov subspace methods. Specifically, for the symmetric case, we prove the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded in the open interval (1/2, 3/2), which results in a linear convergence rate of the PCG method. For the non-symmetric case, we demonstrate that the PGMRES method also achieves a linear convergence rate independent of discretization stepsizes from the residual point of view. These results imply that the iteration counts of the PCG and PGMRES methods are uniformly bounded and independent of the matrix sizes. Numerical experiments in both symmetric and non-symmetric cases in two- and three-dimensions are conducted to confirm the optimal performance of the proposed preconditioned Krylov subspace methods.",

    "abstract": "Let $G$ be graph with vertex set $V(G)$ and order $n$. A coalition in a graph $G$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$, neither of which is a dominating set but whose union $V_1 \\cup V_2$ is a dominating set. A coalition partition, abbreviated $c$-partition, in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\u03c0=\\left\\{V_1 , V_2,\\dots, V_k\\right\\}$ such that every set $V_i$ of $\u03c0$ is either a singleton dominating set, or is not a dominating set but forms a coalition with another set $V_j$ in $\u03c0$. The sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ are coalition partners in $G$. The coalition number $C(G)$ equals the maximum order $k$ of a $c$-partition of $G$. For any graph $G$ with a $c$-partition $\u03c0=\\left\\{V_1,V_2,\\dots,V_k\\right\\}$, the coalition graph $CG(G,\u03c0)$ of $G$ is a graph with vertex set $V_1,V_2,\\dots, V_k$, corresponding one-to-one with the set $\u03c0$, and two vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ are adjacent in $CG(G,\u03c0)$ if and only if the sets $V_i$ and $V_j$ are coalition partners in $\u03c0$. In [4], authors proved that for every graph $G$ there exist a graph $H$ and $c$-partition $\u03c0$ such that $CG(H,\u03c0)\\cong G$, and raised the question: Does there exist a graph $H^*$ of smaller order $n^*$ and size $m^*$ with a $c$-partition $\u03c0^*$ such that $CG(H^*,\u03c0^*)\\cong G$?. In this paper, we constructed a graph $H^*$ of small order and size and a $c$- partition $\u03c0^*$ such that $CG(H^*,\u03c0^*)\\cong G$. Recently, Haynes et al.[5] defined the coalition count $c(G)$ of a graph $G$ as the maximum number of different coalition in any $c$-partition of $G$. We characterize all graphs $G$ with $c(G)=1$. Further, imposing some suitable conditions on coalition number, we study the properties of coalition count of graph.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets across various scientific domains has created a pressing need for new statistical methods to compare distributions supported on their underlying structures. Assessing similarity between datasets whose samples lie on low-dimensional manifolds requires robust techniques capable of separating meaningful signal from noise. We propose a principled framework for statistical inference of similarity and alignment between distributions supported on manifolds underlying high-dimensional datasets in the presence of heterogeneous noise. The key idea is to link the low-rank structure of observed data matrices to their underlying manifold geometry. By analyzing the spectrum of the sample covariance under a manifold signal-plus-noise model, we develop a scale-invariant distance measure between datasets based on their principal variance structures. We further introduce a consistent estimator for this distance and a statistical test for manifold alignability, and establish their asymptotic properties using random matrix theory. The proposed framework accommodates heterogeneous noise across datasets and offers an efficient, theoretically grounded approach for comparing high-dimensional datasets with low-dimensional manifold structures. Through extensive simulations and analyses of multi-sample single-cell datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and statistical power compared with existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary program synthesis systems such as AlphaEvolve, OpenEvolve, and ShinkaEvolve offer a new approach to AI-assisted mathematical discovery. These systems utilize teams of large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate solutions to a problem as human readable code. These candidate solutions are then 'evolved' with the goal of improving them beyond what an LLM can produce in a single shot. While existing mathematical applications have mostly focused on problems of establishing bounds (e.g., sphere packing), the program synthesis approach is well suited to any problem where the solution takes the form of an explicit construction. With this in mind, in this paper we explore the use of OpenEvolve for combinatorial bijection discovery. We describe the results of applying OpenEvolve to three bijection construction problems involving Dyck paths, two of which are known and one of which is open. We find that while systems like OpenEvolve show promise as a valuable tool for combinatorialists, the problem of finding novel, research-level bijections remains a challenging task for current frontier systems, reinforcing the need for human mathematicians in the loop. We describe some lessons learned for others in the field interested in exploring the use of these systems.",

Methods based on the intertwining of supercharges have been extensively used in the literature for exactly solvable systems. We generalize the state-deleting (Krein-Adler) supersymmetric transformations to quasi-exactly exactly solvable (QES) systems building on the Bethe ansatz method and related Bethe roots. This enables us to construct superpartners for a wide class of known QES systems classified previously through a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. We present our constructions of factorizations and intertwining relations related to 1st-order SUSYQM and the $n=1$ state for 10 nonequivalent types, denoted I,...,X. In order to have a unified treatment we rely on their ODE standard form as this is also the appropriate setting to obtain the Bethe ansatz equations which constrain the polynomial solutions. This setting also allows one to deal with systems with $n$ states in a unified manner, using analysis based on the Bethe ansatz equations to build the supersymmetric transformations in terms of the Bethe ansatz roots. We derive the Schr\u00f6dinger potentials for the $n=1$ superpartners of the 10 QES cases and give closed-form solutions for the spectra and wavefunctions of the corresponding QES SUSYQM systems. Furthermore, we present numerical results for higher excited states up to the $n=10$ level. The results obtained may have wider applicability as our framework is built on ODEs with polynomial coefficients.",

    "title": "Extended Contact Algebras: Algebraic analysis and duality theory",
    "abstract": "The ternary extended contact relation was introduced in (Ivanova, 2020) as a more expressive counterpart of the standard binary contact relation. The class of Boolean algebras expanded with the relation was named Extended Contact Algebras (ECAs). In this work, we take an algebraic perspective on ECAs, interpreting the ternary relation as a form of entailment. We introduce Pseudo-Inference Algebras, purely algebraic tructures where the ternary relation is replaced by a monotone ternary operator, capturing the logical character of extended contact. We show that the subclass of relational Pseudo-Inference Algebras corresponds precisely to ECAs and generates a subvariety of strict PSI-Algebras, which forms a discriminator variety. Furthermore, we extend Stone duality to this ternary context, introducing descriptive PSI-frames and establishing three interrelated dualities that differ in their morphisms while sharing the same class of topological objects. The framework developed in the paper provides a nified relational semantics for Boolean algebras equipped with monotone ternary operators, connecting spatial and logical notions within a categorical and topological setting.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel p-adaptive, high-order mesh-free framework for the accurate and efficient simulation of fluid flows in complex geometries. High-order differential operators are constructed locally for arbitrary node distributions using linear combinations of anisotropic basis functions, formulated to ensure the exact reproduction of polynomial fields up to the specified p order. A dynamic p-refinement strategy is developed to refine (increase) or de-refine (decrease) the polynomial order used to approximate derivatives at each node. A new refinement indicator for mesh-free methods is proposed, based on local error estimates of the Laplacian operator, and is incorporated into the solution procedure at minimal added computational cost. Based on this error indicator, a refinement criterion is established to locally adjust the polynomial order p for the solution. The proposed adaptive mesh-free scheme is then applied to a range of canonical PDEs, and its potential is demonstrated in two-dimensional simulations of a compressible reacting flow in porous media. For the test cases studied, the proposed method exhibits potential to save up to 50% of computational costs while maintaining the specified level of accuracy. The results confirm that the developed p-adaptive high-order mesh-free method effectively captures highly non-linear regions where high-order approximation is necessary and reduces computational costs compared to the non-adaptive method, preserving high accuracy and solution stability.",

    "abstract": "We obtain the first rigorous derivation of an incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with self-consistent and time-dependent forcing terms from the inelastic hard-spheres Boltzmann equation associated to the relevant case of viscoelastic granular gases. The model's inelasticity is measured by the so-called restitution coefficient which, for viscoelastic particles, depends on the relative velocities of particles. Through a suitable self-similar change of variables, a balanced dynamic between energy inflow and outflow naturally emerges in the model which permits its analysis. In contrast, such balanced dynamic does not emerge naturally in the constant restitution case and has to be imposed in our previous contribution (Alonso, Lods, Tristani, M\u00e9moires SMF). The exact self-similar rescaling, which allows to capture nontrivial inelastic-hydrodynamic effects, presents itself explicitly in terms of the Knudsen number and the restitution coefficient. The consequence of such scaling is a non-autonomous rescaled Boltzmann equation whose solutions converge, in a specific weak sense, towards the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit. The incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system obtained by this process appears to be new in this context. As a byproduct of the analysis, we determine the exact dissipation rate of the granular temperature known as \\emph{Haff's law}.",

Recent advances use kernel methods to estimate nonparametric causal relationships, with general data types, while retaining a simple closed-form expression. Empirical researchers ultimately need reliable inference on causal estimates; however, uniform confidence sets for the method remain unavailable. To fill this gap, we develop valid and sharp confidence sets for kernel instrumental variable regression, allowing general nonlinearities and data types. Computationally, our bootstrap procedure requires only a single run of the kernel instrumental variable regression estimator. Theoretically, it relies on the same key assumptions. Overall, we provide a practical procedure for inference that substantially increases the value of kernel methods for causal analysis.",

Using a recently proposed framework by one of the authors, we analyze this class for Gaussian entries and derive an explicit, closed-form expression for the joint distribution of a complex eigenvalue and its right eigenvector for arbitrary matrix size $N\\ge 2$ in the entire complex plane. From this, we obtain the distribution of the eigenvector non-orthogonality overlap and the mean eigenvalue density, both for finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit. Notably, at the spectral edge both the eigenvalue density and eigenvector statistics exhibits a limiting behavior that differs from the Ginibre universtality class.

We first prove the existence of weak solutions for the case of regular double-well potentials, using a minimizing movement scheme to construct approximate solutions. The analysis is then extended to singular potentials, e.g., the Flory--Huggins potential, by approximating them with a Moreau--Yosida regularization. For both cases, we establish higher regularity, continuous dependence on the initial data, and consequently the uniqueness of weak solutions. Finally, we propose a well-posed finite element discretization of the model and present numerical experiments illustrating the effect of different physical parameters on the resulting membrane patterns. Depending on the parameter regime, we observe purely striped, dotted, or snake-like structures.",

We identify a sequence of characteristic time scales $\\{T_\u03b5^i\\}_{1 \\leq i \\leq \\abs{V'}}$ and characterize the asymptotic behavior of the diffusion process both at intermediate time scales and at the first critical time scale. Our analysis relies on a refined understanding of the narrow escape problem in domains with bottlenecks, in particular on estimates for the exit place and on the conditional distribution of the exit time given the exit place, results that may be of independent interest.",

Taking the reversed point of view, we show that any finite dimensional family of polynomials belonging to the Askey scheme can be interpreted as Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of an algebra. The Hahn polynomials are thus associated to the oscillator algebra with the Krawtchouk polynomials treated through a limit. The dual Hahn polynomials and Racah polynomials are seen to be associated to $sl_2$ with a more general coproduct than the standard one.

Prior results establish the existence of a $\\exists$ normal form for R by other methods.

To this end, we introduce five 'unorthodox' algebras that will play a major role, not only in providing a positive answer to the question, but also in their similarity to the 2-element Boolean algebra 2. Yet, they are remarkably dissimilar from 2 in many respects. In this paper, we will examine these five algebras both algebraically and logically. We define, and initiate an investigation into, a subvariety, called RUNO1, of the variety of De Morgan semi-Heyting algebras and show that RUNO1 is, in fact, the variety generated by the five algebras. Then several applications of this theorem are given. It is shown that RUNO1 is a discriminator variety and that all five algebras are primal. It is also shown that every subvariety of RUNO1 satisfies the Strong Amalgamation Property and the property that epimorphisms are surjective (ES). It is shown that the lattice of subvarieties of RUNO1 is a Boolean lattice of 32 elements. The bases for all the subvarieties of RUNO1 are also given. We introduce a new logic called mathcal{RUNO1} and show that it is algebraizable with the variety RUNO1 as its equivalent algebraic semantics. We then present axiomatizations for all 32 axiomatic extensions of mathcal{RUNO1} and deduce that all the axiomatic extensions are decidable. The paper ends with some open problems.",

    "title": "Secure coalitions in graphs",
    "abstract": "A secure coalition in a graph $G$ consists of two disjoint vertex sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, neither of which is a secure dominating set, but whose union $V_1 \\cup V_2$ forms a secure dominating set. A secure coalition partition ($sec$-partition) of $G$ is a vertex partition $\u03c0= \\{V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_k\\}$ where each set $V_i$ is either a secure dominating set consisting of a single vertex of degree $n-1$, or a set that is not a secure dominating set but forms a secure coalition with some other set $V_j \\in \u03c0$. The maximum cardinality of a secure coalition partition of $G$ is called the secure coalition number of $G$, denoted $SEC(G)$. For every $sec$-partition $\u03c0$ of a graph $G$, we associate a graph called the secure coalition graph of $G$ with respect to $\u03c0$, denoted $SCG(G,\u03c0)$, where the vertices of $SCG(G,\u03c0)$ correspond to the sets $V_1, V_2, \\dots, V_k$ of $\u03c0$, and two vertices are adjacent in $SCG(G,\u03c0)$ if and only if their corresponding sets in $\u03c0$ form a secure coalition in $G$. In this study, we prove that every graph admits a $sec$-partition. Further, we characterize the graphs $G$ with $SEC(G) \\in \\{1,2,n\\}$ and all trees $T$ with $SEC(T) = n-1$. Finally, we show that every graph $G$ without isolated vertices is a secure coalition graph.",

    "title": "Inverse Electromagnetic Scattering for Doubly-Connected Cylinders using Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem for a magneto-dielectric cylinder covering an impedance cylinder of arbitrary shape. We solve it by introducing a divide-and-conquer framework using specially designed 1D multi-channel, circular-padding Convolutional Neural Networks. The solution of the direct problem provides us with the real and imaginary components of the far-field measurements representing the input data. We first classify the shape of the impedance cylinder and then reconstruct the unknown boundary curve and the impedance function. Through extensive numerical experiments, including noisy scenarios, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach.",
