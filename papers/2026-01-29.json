    "title": "On groups definable in $p$-adically closed fields",
    "abstract": "This paper is about the $dfg$/$fsg$ decomposition for groups $G$ definable in $p$-adically closed fields. It is proved that for $G$ definably amenable, $G$ has a definable normal $dfg$ subgroup $H$ such that the quotient $G/H$ is a definable $fsg$ group. The result was known for groups definable in $o$-minimal expansions of real closed fields (see \\cite{C-P-o-mini}). We also give a version for arbitrary (not necessarily definably amenable) groups $G$ definable in $p$-adically closed fields: there is a definable $dfg$ subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that the homogeneous space $G/H$ is definable and definably compact. (In the $o$-minimal case this is Fact 3.25 of \\cite{Peterzil-Starchenko-mutypes}).\n  Note that $dfg$ stands for ``has a definable $f$-generic type\", and $fsg$ for ``has finitely satisfiable generics\", which will be discussed together with various equivalences.\n  We will need to understand something about groups of the form $G(k)$ where $k$ is a $p$-adically closed field and $G$ a semisimple algebraic group over $k$, and as part of the analysis we will prove the Kneser-Tits conjecture over $p$-adically closed fields.",

    "title": "New Adaptive Numerical Methods Based on Dual Formulation of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an adaptive high-order method for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The proposed method is based on a dual formulation approach: Two numerical solutions, corresponding to conservative and nonconservative formulations of the same system, are evolved simultaneously. Since nonconservative schemes are known to produce nonphysical weak solutions near discontinuities, we exploit the difference between these two solutions to construct a smoothness indicator (SI). In smooth regions, the difference between the conservative and nonconservative solutions is of the same order as the truncation error of the underlying discretization, whereas in nonsmooth regions, it is ${\\cal O}(1)$. We apply this idea to the Euler equations of gas dynamics and define the SI using differences in the momentum and pressure variables. This choice allows us to further distinguish neighborhoods of contact discontinuities from other nonsmooth parts of the computed solution. The resulting classification is used to adaptively select numerical discretizations. In the vicinities of contact discontinuities, we employ the low-dissipation central-upwind numerical flux and a second-order piecewise linear reconstruction with the slopes computed using an overcompressive SBM limiter. Elsewhere, we use an alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) framework with the central-upwind finite-volume numerical fluxes and either unlimited (in smooth regions) or Ai-WENO-Z (in the nonsmooth regions away from contact discontinuities) fifth-order interpolation. Numerical results for the one- and two-dimensional compressible Euler equations show that the proposed adaptive method improves both the computational efficiency and resolution of complex flow features compared with the non-adaptive fifth-order A-WENO scheme.",

The interaction of resonant 3-solitons is accompanied by soliton reconnection phenomena, characterized by the disappearance and reconnection of stem structures. This paper investigates variable-length stem structures in resonant 3-soliton solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili II (KPII) equation, focusing on both 2-resonant and 3-resonant 3-soliton cases. Depending on the phase shift tends to plus/minus infinity, different types of resonances are identified, including strong resonance, weak resonance, and mixed (strong-weak) resonance. We derive and analyze the asymptotic forms and explicit expressions for the soliton arm trajectories, velocities, as well as the endpoints, length, and amplitude of the stem structures. A detailed comparison is made between the similarities and differences of the stem structures in the 2-resonant and 3-resonant solitons. In addition, we provide a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of both the asymptotic behavior and the structural properties of the stems.",

In this paper, we study the asymptotic enumeration of both labeled and unlabeled Cayley graphs of abelian groups whose standard double cover has the smallest possible automorphism group.

    "title": "Improving Smoothed Aggregation AMG Robustness on Stretched Mesh Applications",
    "abstract": "Strength-of-connection algorithms play a key role in algebraic multigrid (AMG). Specifically, they determine which matrix nonzeros are classified as weak and so ignored when coarsening matrix graphs and defining interpolation sparsity patterns. The general goal is to encourage coarsening only in directions where error can be smoothed and to avoid coarsening across sharp problem variations. Unfortunately, developing robust and inexpensive strength-of-connection schemes is challenging.\n  The classification of matrix nonzeros involves four aspects: (a) choosing a strength-of-connection matrix, (b) scaling its values, (c) choosing a criterion to classify scaled values as strong or weak, and (d) dropping weak entries which includes adjusting matrix values to account for dropped terms. Typically, smoothed aggregation AMG uses the linear system being solved as a strength-of-connection matrix. It scales values symmetrically using square-roots of the matrix diagonal. It classifies based on whether scaled values are above or below a threshold. Finally, it adjusts matrix values by modifying the diagonal so that the sum of entries within each row of the dropped matrix matches that of the original. While these procedures can work well, we illustrate failure cases that motivate alternatives. The first alternative uses a distance Laplacian strength-of-connection matrix. The second centers on non-symmetric scaling. We then investigate alternative classification criteria based on identifying gaps in the values of the scaled entries. Finally, an alternative lumping procedure is proposed where row sums are preserved by modifying all retained matrix entries (as opposed to just diagonal entries). A series of numerical results illustrates trade-offs demonstrating in some cases notably more robust convergence on matrices coming from linear finite elements on stretched meshes.",

    "abstract": "For a prime $p$ and an associative ring $R$ with unity, there are various constructions of $p$-typical Witt vectors of $R$, all of which specialize to the classical $p$-typical Witt vectors when $R$ is commutative. These constructions are endowed with a Verschiebung operator $V$ and a Teichm\u00fcller map $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$, and they satisfy the property that the map $x \\mapsto V\\langle x^p\\rangle - p\\langle x \\rangle$ is additive. In this paper, we adapt the group-theoretic universal characterization of classical $p$-typical Witt vectors proposed in arXiv:2405.12680 to the non-commutative setting. Our main result is that this approach yields a construction of Witt vectors for associative rings, denoted $E$, which specializes correctly to the classical Witt functor in the commutative case. The construction of $E$ is inspired by the Witt functor of Cuntz--Deninger, and we show that $E$ is a universal pre-Witt functor, subject to an explicit conjecture concerning non-commutative polynomials. We further introduce the notion of a Witt functor and construct a universal Witt functor $\\hat{E}$, which is closely related to Hesselholt's Witt functor $W_H$. We suspect that $W_H$ is, in fact, the universal Morita-invariant Witt functor.",

Building on this approach, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA) variant, Decentralized SCA Momentum-based Prox-Linear (D-SCAMPL), which handles additional objective structure through strongly convex surrogate subproblems while still allowing infeasible initialization. Both methods incorporate recursive momentum-based gradient estimators and a consensus mechanism requiring only two communication rounds per iteration. Under standard smoothness and regularity assumptions, both algorithms achieve an oracle complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-3/2})$, matching the optimal rate known for unconstrained centralized stochastic non-convex optimization.

    "abstract": "The aim of the paper is twofold. We establish refined Strichartz estimates for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on tori within the framework of partial regularity. As a result, we reveal that the solution of the free Schr\u00f6dinger equation has better regularity in mixed Lebesgue spaces. This complements the well-established theory over the past few decades, where initial data comes from the Sobolev space with respect to all spatial variables. As an application, we obtain local well-posedness for non-gauge-invariant nonlinearities with partially regular initial data. On the other hand, we extend refined Strichartz estimates for infinite systems of orthonormal functions, which generalizes the classical orthonormal Strichartz estimates on the torus by Nakamura [41] . As an application, we establish well-posedness for the Hartree equation for infinitely many fermions in some Schatten spaces. In the process, we develop several harmonic analysis tools for mixed Lebesgue spaces, e.g. Fourier multiplier transference principle, vector-valued Bernstein inequality, and vector-valued Littlewood--Paley theory for densities of operators, which may be of independent interest and complement the results of [45,55].",

    "title": "Optimal matching under size priority",
    "abstract": "Past studies on the local limit of maximal weight matchings in edge-weighted large random graphs rely fundamentally on the assumption that the weights are atomless, which ensures that the maximal weight matching is unique. This excludes de facto maximal size matchings that correspond to equal edge-weights. In this work, we overcome this difficulty by assigning i.i.d.~atomless weights to edges and choosing the maximal size matching that maximises the weight. We call these doubly constrained matchings \\emph{optimal matchings}. The natural generalisation of optimal matchings for infinite unimodular random graphs are unimodular matchings of maximal density at the root that maximise the expected weight at the root when it is matched.\n  For unimodular Bienaym\u00e9-Galton-Watson (UBGW) trees and for a broad class of weight distributions, we show existence and uniqueness in law of such matchings. We also prove that if a sequence of finite random weighted graphs converges locally to an UBGW tree with i.i.d.~weights, then there exists a sequence of matchings on the finite graphs that converges locally to the optimal matching on the limiting tree. Finally, we identify a regime, depending only on the offspring distribution of the limiting tree, in which correlations between edge states in the optimal matching decay exponentially with their graph distance. In this regime, we strengthen the previous convergence to the convergence of optimal matchings of the finite graphs. As a by-product, we can explicitly compute the asymptotic densities of edges that belong to all maximal-density matchings, and of edges that belong to none.",

Extending spectral diffusion approaches to spherical data, however, raises nontrivial geometric and stochastic issues that are absent in the Euclidean setting.\n  In this work, we develop a diffusion modeling framework defined directly on finite-dimensional spherical harmonic representations of real-valued functions on the sphere. We show that the spherical discrete Fourier transform maps spatial Brownian motion to a constrained Gaussian process in the frequency domain with deterministic, generally non-isotropic covariance. This induces modified forward and reverse-time stochastic differential equations in the spectral domain.\n  As a consequence, spatial and spectral score matching objectives are no longer equivalent, even in the band-limited setting, and the frequency-domain formulation introduces a geometry-dependent inductive bias. We derive the corresponding diffusion equations and characterize the induced noise covariance.",

The Fokker--Planck equation provides a natural framework for describing the evolution of probability densities associated with such dynamics. While Fokker--Planck equations on metric graphs have been studied from an analytical viewpoint, their optimal control remains largely unexplored, particularly in settings where the control acts through the drift term. In this paper, we investigate an optimal control problem governed by the Fokker--Planck equation on a star graph, with a bilinear control appearing in the drift. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation and prove the existence of at least one optimal control. The associated adjoint system is derived, and first-order necessary optimality conditions are formulated. A wavelet-based numerical scheme is proposed to approximate the optimal solution, and its performance is illustrated through representative numerical experiments. These results contribute to the analytical and computational understanding of controlled stochastic dynamics on network-like domains.",

The system model describes a reversible reaction with arbitrary stoichiometric coefficients, where one chemical is present in a bounded vessel $\u03a9$ and the other chemical lies only on the boundary $\\partial\u03a9$ where the reaction takes place. In the limit as the reaction rate constant tends to infinity, we prove that the solution converges strongly to that of a heat equation with nonlinear dynamical boundary condition. This is obtained by showing a-priori estimates of solutions which are uniform in the reaction rate constants. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by the bulk-surface coupling, we consider the limit in suitable product spaces where the Aubin-Lions lemma is applicable. Moreover, in the case of equal stoichiometric coefficients, we obtain the convergence rate of the fast reaction limit by exploiting suitable estimates of the limiting system.",

We propose the adaptive conditional gradient sliding method (AdCGS), a projection-free and line-search-free method that retains Nesterov's acceleration with adaptive stepsizes based on local Lipschitz estimates. AdCGS combines an accelerated outer scheme with an LMO-based inner routine. It reuses gradients across multiple LMO calls to reduce gradient evaluations, while controlling the subproblem inexactness via a prescribed accuracy level coupled with adaptive stepsizes. We prove accelerated convergence rates for convex objective functions matching those of projection-based accelerated methods, while requiring no projection oracle. For strongly convex objective functions, we further establish linear convergence without additional geometric assumptions on the constraint set, such as polytopes or strongly convex sets. Experiments on constrained $\\ell_p$ regression, logistic regression with real-world datasets, and least-squares problems demonstrate improvements over both projection-free and projection-based baselines.",

This ``blessing of dimensionality'' in bandwidth selection offers theoretical support for utilizing the conceptually simpler cross-validation selector over plug-in techniques for larger dimensions $d$. We compare this result for bandwidth estimation on the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space through explicit expressions for the asymptotic variance functionals.

Furthermore, for subcritical initial data, we prove an exponential decay rate to the equilibrium state.

    "abstract": "We develop a kernel-based approach for estimating the spatially varying Sobolev regularity~$s$ of an unknown $d$-variate function~$f$ from scattered sampling data, which quantifies the degree of local differentiability supported by the data. Relying only on neighborhood data near the point of interest $z\\in \u03a9_z$, our method constructs a sequence of Sobolev-space reproducing kernel interpolants whose kernel smoothness order is specified by an index~$m > d/2$. The native-space norms of these interpolants are evaluated over a bounded range of~$m$, producing a \\emph{Sobolev-scale norm profile}. The elbow of this profile serves as a quantitative probe of the underlying local regularity~$s(\u03a9_z)$. In particular, when $m > s(\u03a9_z)$, the profile exhibits rapid, near-worst-case growth governed by the classical upper bound associated with the conditioning of the kernel matrix. A band-limited surrogate analysis explains this transition and establishes a lower-bound relation linking native-norm growth to the Sobolev regularity of~$f$. Two complementary strategies are incorporated for further enhancement: (i)~a \\emph{stencil-shift} subroutine, which repositions local neighborhoods to avoid crossing discontinuities whenever possible, thereby suppressing artifacts in the norm estimates; and (ii)~a local--global \\emph{norm-sweep comparison} strategy that combines short two-point local tails with an optional one-point global screen to detect outlier $\u03a9_z$ of low Sobolev regularity and accelerate evaluation on large datasets. Numerical experiments on synthetic test functions and turbulent-flow data demonstrate accurate recovery of spatially varying regularity and confirm the robustness of the proposed characterization for kernel-based approximation and differentiation.",

Together with the pointwise invariant $P+A$, these identities yield global existence, positivity, and long-time reduction to limiting $(S,R)$ kinetics with a unique globally attracting coexistence state. Neumann eigenmode reduction gives closed dispersion relations. The base $(S,R)$ reaction--diffusion block remains stable for all nonconstant modes for any $d_S,d_R>0$, excluding classical Turing destabilization. Chemotaxis is posed via a diffusive cue $c$, since $\\nabla A$ is undefined for non-diffusive $A$. In one-way damped coupling, the linearized mode matrix is block triangular and leaves the $(S,R)$ spectrum unchanged. Two-way coupling adds a feedback rank-one mobility correction, induces effective cross-diffusion, and admits mode growth.

The LSNN method is built on an equivalent least-squares formulation of the underlying problem on an admissible solution set that accommodates discontinuous solutions. It employs ReLU neural networks (in place of finite elements) as the approximating functions, uses a carefully designed physics-preserved numerical differentiation, and avoids penalization techniques such as artificial viscosity, entropy condition, and/or total variation. This approach captures shock features in the solution without oscillations or overshooting. Efficiently and reliably solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem posed by the LSNN method remains an open challenge.

The theory rigorously establishes that these bases emerge as explicit linear combinations of B-spline element bases. For any prescribed smoothness requirements, this element-wise formulation enables the Hermite interpolation at nodes, which directly utilizes function values and derivatives without solving global linear systems. By focusing on explicit interpolation properties, element-wise analysis establishes optimal approximation errors, even when the space smoothness attains its theoretical maximum for the space degree. In isogeometric analysis (IgA), the construction naturally decomposes geometric mappings into element-level representations, allowing efficient computations across elements regardless of node distribution. Notably, the same Hermite interpolation framework simultaneously handles domain parameterization and IgA solutions, allowing direct imposition of boundary conditions through function and derivative matching. Numerical tests demonstrate optimal convergence rates and superconvergence properties in 2D IgA under uniform knot configurations, and improved computational efficiency in 3D IgA with non-uniform knot distributions.",

Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who has knowledge of the detector's false alarm constraint parameter $\u03b3$ and selects a stationary post-change distribution that depends on it, seeking to remain undetected for as long as possible. Building on the theoretical foundations of the CuSum procedure, we rigorously characterize the asymptotic behavior of the average detection delay (ADD) and the average time to false alarm (AT2FA) when the post-change distribution converges to the pre-change distribution as $\u03b3\\to \\infty$. Our analysis establishes exact asymptotic expressions for these quantities, extending and refining classical results that no longer hold in this regime. We identify the critical scaling laws governing covert behavior and derive explicit conditions under which an adversary can maintain covertness, defined by ADD = $\u0398(\u03b3)$, whereas in the classical setting, ADD grows only as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \u03b3)$. In particular, for Gaussian and Exponential models under adversarial perturbations of their respective parameters, we asymptotically characterize ADD as a function of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions and $\u03b3$.",

Our edgelighter error model, a variant of the classical lamplighter random walk, iteratively corrupts the graph $G_0$ with edge-dependent noise, creating a sequence of noisy graph copies $(G_t)$. Much of the graph matching literature is focused on anonymization thresholds in edge-independent noise settings, and we establish novel anonymization thresholds in this edge-dependent noise setting when matching $G_0$ and $G_t$. Moreover, we also compare this anonymization threshold with the mixing properties of the Markov chain noise model. We show that when $G_0$ is drawn from an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi model, the graph matching anonymization threshold and the mixing time of the edgelighter walk are both of order $\u0398(n^2\\log n)$. We further demonstrate that for more structured model for $G_0$ (e.g., the Stochastic Block Model), graph matching anonymization can occur in $O(n^\u03b1\\log n)$ time for some $\u03b1<2$, indicating that anonymization can occur before the Markov chain noise model globally mixes. Through extensive simulations, we verify our theoretical bounds in the settings of Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs and stochastic block model random graphs, and explore our findings on real-world datasets derived from a Facebook friendship network and a European research institution email communication network.",

Although every graph admits a 1-11-representation, the repetition patterns that may or must appear in such representations have not been fully studied.\n  In this paper, we study cube-free and square-free 1-11-representations of graphs. We first show that cubes cannot always be avoided in 1-11-representations of minimum length by providing a graph for which every minimum-length 1-11-representation necessarily contains a cube. We then focus on permutational 1-11-representations, where the representing word is a concatenation of permutations of the vertex set. In this setting, we prove that any cube appearing in a permutational 1-11-representation can be removed without changing the represented graph. As a consequence, every permutational 1-11-representation attaining the permutational 1-11-representation number is cube-free. We further show that this behaviour does not extend to squares by providing a graph for which every permutational 1-11-representation with the minimum number of permutations necessarily contains a square.\n  Finally, we prove that the language of all 1-11-representations of a given graph is regular. Moreover, we show that the language of all permutational 1-11-representations of a graph is also regular.",

Such a (total-)dominating set endowed with a separation property is often referred to as a code of the graph. In this paper, we study the four separation properties location, closed-separation, open-separation and full-separation. We address the complexity of finding minimum separating sets in a graph and study the interplay of these separation properties with several codes (establishing a particularly close relation between separation and codes based on domination) as well as the interplay of separation and complementation (showing that location and full-separation are the same on a graph and its complement, whereas closed-separation in a graph corresponds to open-separation in its complement).",

Our model contains an Allee effect that induces a saddle point and admits an explicit solution along with the extinction threshold of a time-dependent Allee parameter. More specifically, we derive an integral inequality that serves as a necessary condition for the occurrence of rate-induced tipping. A remarkable point in the proposed model is that it can handle population extinction such that the solution completely vanishes in a finite amount of time. An unconditionally stable cubature method suitable for our model is proposed, and its superiority over the classical forward Euler method is discussed.

We prove that under some restrictions, an alternating snake defines a canonical monoidal category. We prove that this category has finitely many prime objects. As a consequence we prove that the Grothendieck ring is isomorphic to the Grothendieck ring of the category $\\mathscr C_\u03be$ for a suitable height function. In particular it follows that the special family of alternating snakes provides a monoidal categorification of a cluster algebra of type $A_N$ for a suitable value of $N$.",

    "abstract": "We analyze a bioeconomic model for optimal fishery harvesting in a spatially heterogeneous habitat comprising both harvestable and preservation (reserve) zones. The population dynamics are governed by a hybrid system coupling continuous time within-season dynamics -mortality, harvesting, and dispersal -with a discrete-time Beverton-Holt reproduction map. We derive the necessary and sufficient condition $Fr > 1$ for long-term population persistence, where $F$ encapsulates within-season survival including harvesting effects and $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate. Through bifurcation analysis, we demonstrate that marine protected areas (MPAs) significantly expand the sustainable parameter space. Using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we characterize the optimal harvesting strategy as a composite Bang-Singular-Bang control. We derive an explicit state-feedback formula for the singular arc and verify its optimality via the Generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition. Numerical simulations reveal that this dynamic strategy significantly outperforms constant maximum-effort policies, yielding higher cumulative revenue while maintaining the population above the critical collapse threshold through a stable \"sawtooth\" trajectory. Our results highlight that modest preservation (20-30% of habitat) allows for more intensive, profitable harvesting in open zones without risking resource extinction.",

In such a labeling, the vertices are labeled with unique values from one up to the number of vertices so that the sum of labels on the neighbors of any vertex is the same across all vertices. For oriented graphs, a related concept of distance difference magic has been studied. In a distance difference magic labeling, each vertex is given a unique value from one up to the number of vertices such that for each vertex the sums of the labels of vertices in the in-neighborhood minus the sums of the labels of vertices in the out-neighborhood equals zero. In this paper, we expand on this concept by showing a connected difference distance magic oriented graph on $n$ vertices exists for each integer $n \\geq 5$. We also construct arbitrarily large difference distance magic oriented graphs from smaller ones using a new graph sum and exhibit a connection between linear algebra and this type of labeling.",

In this model, the infection fronts are represented by fixed boundaries during the dry season and by moving boundaries during the wet season, with impulsive intervention occurring at the end of each wet season. The simultaneous introduction of impulsive intervention and seasonal switching creates new difficulties for mathematical analysis. We overcome these challenges through novel analytical techniques, resulting in a spreading-vanishing dichotomy and a sharp criteria governing this dichotomy. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the theoretical results and to visually illustrate the influence of seasonal switching and impulsive intervention. Our results mathematically explain that two factors, the duration of the dry season and the intensity of impulsive intervention are both positively correlated with effective disease control.",

We study two cases: (i) strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objective function and (ii) convex but possibly nonsmooth objective function. To deal with the constraints that are not easy to project on, we use a randomized feasibility algorithm with Polyak steps and a random number of sampled constraints per iteration, while taking (sub)gradient steps to minimize the objective function. For case (i), we prove linear convergence in expectation of the objective function values to any prescribed tolerance using an adaptive stepsize. For case (ii), we develop a fully problem parameter-free and adaptive stepsize scheme that yields an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ worst-case rate in expectation. The infeasibility of the iterates decreases geometrically with the number of feasibility updates almost surely, while for the averaged iterates, we establish an expected lower bound on the function values relative to the optimal value that depends on the distribution for the random number of sampled constraints. For certain choices of sample-size growth, optimal rates are achieved.

Under uniform random design, the regression model admits an exact diagonalization in the spherical harmonic basis, yielding a Gaussian sequence representation with frequency-dependent multiplicities.\n  Exploiting this structure, we derive closed-form posterior distributions, optimal spectral truncation schemes, and sharp posterior contraction rates under integrated squared loss. For Gaussian priors with polynomially decaying angular power spectra, including spherical Mat\u00e9rn priors, we establish posterior contraction rates over Sobolev classes, which are minimax-optimal under correct prior calibration.\n  We further show that the posterior mean admits an exact variational characterization as a geometrically intrinsic penalized least-squares estimator, equivalent to a Laplace-Beltrami smoothing spline.",

    "title": "Sufficiently Regularized Nonnegative Quartic Polynomials are Sum-of-Squares",
    "abstract": "Hilbert's 17th problem famously established that not all nonnegative polynomials admit a sum-of-squares (SoS) representation. Hilbert also identified a few special classes in which nonnegativity and SoS are equivalent, such as univariate polynomials, quadratic polynomials, and bivariate quartic polynomials. In this paper, we extend this equivalence to several new subclasses of multivariate quartically regularized polynomials and characterize the NP-hardness boundary of these special-structure polynomials. Specifically, we consider the global optimization of multivariate symmetric cubic polynomials regularized by weighted quartic powers of the Euclidean norm. These special-structure polynomials arise as iterative subproblems in high-order tensor methods for nonconvex optimization problems. We consider shifting these polynomials by their global optimum so as to make them nonnegative, and show that for sufficiently large regularization parameters and under mild assumptions, these polynomials admit a sum-of-squares representation. We also identify several structured subclasses of quartically regularized cubic polynomials for which global optimality of the model implies that nonnegativity is certified by a sum-of-squares decomposition for all values of the regularization parameter, including quadratic-quartic polynomials and quartic polynomials containing a special cubic term that can be decomposed as the product of a quadratic norm and a linear form. We provide counterexamples based on quartic separable norms that demonstrate the crucial role of the Euclidean norm in these representations. Finally, we illustrate how these SoS-based certificates can be used for Taylor subproblems arising in high-order tensor methods for nonconvex optimization, with encouraging numerical results.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the optimal dividend problem with a bounded payout rate in a partially observed regime-switching diffusion model, where, in practice, the market regime is unobserved and key model parameters are unknown. To address this partial-information setting, we propose a continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) approach within an exploratory (entropy-regularized) stochastic control framework for discounted dividends under regime switching. The associated exploratory Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system admits semi-analytical characterizations of the value function and the optimal exploratory dividend policy, determined by two unknown functions solving two ordinary differential equations (ODEs) together with positive real roots of the induced quadratic equations. Exploiting this structure, we introduce parametric families for both the value function and the policy, using low-degree polynomial approximations to the ODE solutions. We then develop an actor-critic RL algorithm to learn the optimal exploratory policy through interactions with the market environment: it performs belief-state filtering from observed data and iterates policy evaluation and policy improvement online to refine the policy. Numerical experiments demonstrate strong out-of-sample performance of the learned dividend policies.",

After introducing the C*- and W*-algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics, the paper reviews quantum dynamical systems, KMS states, and Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, as well as CCR and CAR algebras for bosonic and fermionic systems. Particular emphasis is placed on infinite systems, non-equilibrium steady states, entropy production, and linear response theory. The later sections develop a systematic treatment of small systems coupled to reservoirs, open lattice quantum spin systems, culminating in a detailed discussion of competing notions of quantum entropy production.

    "abstract": "The orthogonal group synchronization problem, which aims to recover a set of $d \\times d$ orthogonal matrices from their pairwise noisy products, plays a fundamental role in signal processing, computer vision, and network analysis. In recent years, numerous optimization techniques, such as semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and low-rank (Burer-Monteiro) factorization, have been proposed to address this problem and their theoretical guarantees have been extensively studied. While SDR is provably powerful and exact in recovering the least-squares estimator under certain mild conditions, it is not scalable. In contrast, the low-rank factorization is highly efficient but nonconvex, meaning its iterates may get trapped in local minima. To close the gap, we analyze the low-rank approach and focus on understanding when the associated nonconvex optimization landscape is benign, i.e., free of spurious local minima. Recent works suggest that the benignness depends on the condition number of the Hessian at the global minimizer, but it remains unclear whether sharp guarantees can be achieved. In this work, we consider the low-rank approach which corresponds to an optimization problem over the Stiefel manifold ${\\rm St}(p,d)^{\\otimes n}$. By formulating the landscape analysis into another convex optimization problem, we provide a unified characterization of the optimization landscape for all parameter pairs $(p,d)$ with $p \\geq d+2$ for $d\\geq 1$ and $p = d+1$ for $1\\leq d\\leq 3$ which gives a much improved dependence on the condition number of the Hessian. Our results recover the known sharp state-of-the-art bound for $d=1$ which is extremely useful for characterizing the Kuramoto synchronization, and significantly improved the guarantees for the general case $d \\geq 2$ with $p \\geq d+2$ over the existing results. The theoretical results are versatile and applicable to a wide range of examples.",

It has been shown by K\u00e4mmerer and Volkmer (2019) that algorithms based on multiple rank-1 lattices achieve the optimal convergence rate for the $L_{\\infty}$ error in Wiener-type spaces, up to logarithmic factors. While this result was translated to weighted Korobov spaces in the recent monograph by Dick, Kritzer, and Pillichshammer (2022), the analysis requires the smoothness parameter $\u03b1$ to be greater than $1$ and is restricted to product weights. In this paper, we extend this result for multiple rank-1 lattice-based algorithms to the case where $1/2<\u03b1\\le 1$ and for general weights, covering a broader range of periodic functions with low smoothness and general relative importance of variables. We also provide a summability condition on the weights to ensure strong polynomial tractability for any $\u03b1>1/2$. Furthermore, by incorporating random shifts into multiple rank-1 lattice-based algorithms, we prove that the resulting randomized algorithm achieves a nearly optimal convergence rate in terms of the worst-case root mean squared $L_2$ error, while retaining the same tractability property.",

Since the function $f(u):=au^p -\u03bbu$, $u\\geq 0$, is not increasing if $\u03bb>0$, the uniqueness of the positive solution of (1.1) is far from obvious, in general, even for the simplest case when $a(x)$ is a positive constant.

In this regard, we propose a dynamic scheme for joint antenna and power adaptation to improve NES from a user scheduling and resource allocation perspective. Antenna adaptation is performed using the multiple channel state information resource signal (CSI-RS) framework. Furthermore, the recently introduced transmit power-aware link adaptation scheme, referred to as POLITE for short, is used as the power adaptation technique. The proposed scheme adapts to variations in users' instantaneous traffic and channel conditions to opportunistically maximize NES while also inherently accounting for the user throughput. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed scheme consistently achieves a balance between NES and user perceived throughput (UPT) for different network load conditions. Especially in low and light load conditions, the proposed scheme significantly improves the intra-cell interference and boosts the overall NES, while ensuring that UPT is unaffected.",

    "abstract": "We present the first rigorous convergence analysis of the smoothed adaptive finite element method (S-AFEM) proposed in [Mulita, Giani, Heltai: SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 43, 2021]. S-AFEM modifies the classical adaptive finite element method (AFEM) by performing accurate discrete solves only on periodically determined mesh levels, while the intermediate levels employ a fixed number of cheap smoothing iterations. Numerical experiments in that work showed that this strategy generates adapted meshes comparable to those of AFEM at substantially lower computational cost. In this paper, we prove unconditional full R-linear convergence of a suitable quasi-error quantity and, for sufficiently small adaptivity parameters, optimal convergence rates with respect to the overall computational cost. The analysis requires only a mild uniform stability assumption on the employed smoother, satisfied by standard methods such as Richardson, Gauss-Seidel, conjugate gradient, and multigrid schemes. Our results apply to general second-order linear elliptic PDEs and show that S-AFEM retains all desired abstract convergence guarantees of AFEM while reducing the cumulative computational time. Numerical experiments validate the theory, analyze runtime performance, and underline the potential of S-AFEM for speed-up in AFEM computations.",

LCD codes have a trivial hull so they are counterparts of self-orthogonal codes. So it is a natural question whether one can embed linear codes into optimal LCD codes. To answer it, we first determine the number of columns to be added to a generator matrix of a linear code in order to embed the given code into an LCD code. Then we characterize all possible forms of shortest LCD embeddings of a linear code. As examples, we start from binary and ternary Hamming codes of small lengths and obtain optimal LCD codes with minimum distance 4. Furthermore, we find new ternary LCD codes with parameters including $[23, 4, 14]$, $[23, 5, 12]$, $[24, 6, 12]$, and $[25, 5, 14]$ and a new quaternary LCD $[21, 10, 8]$ code, each of which has minimum distance one greater than those of known codes. This shows that our shortest LCD embedding method is useful in finding optimal LCD codes over various fields.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian process regression uses data measured at sensor locations to reconstruct a spatially dependent function with quantified uncertainty. However, if only a limited number of sensors can be deployed, it is important to determine how to optimally place the sensors to minimize a measure of the uncertainty in the reconstruction. We consider the Bayesian D-optimal criterion to determine the optimal sensor locations by choosing sensors from a candidate set of sensors. Since this is an NP-hard problem, our approach models sensor placement as a column subset selection problem (CSSP) on the covariance matrix, computed using the kernel function on the candidate sensor points. We propose an algorithm that uses the Golub-Klema-Stewart framework (GKS) to select sensors and provide an analysis of lower bounds on the D-optimality of these sensor placements. To reduce the computational cost in the GKS step, we propose and analyze algorithms for the D-optimal sensor placements using Nystr\u00f6m approximations on the covariance matrix. Moreover, we propose several algorithms that select sensors via Nystr\u00f6m approximation of the covariance matrix, utilizing the randomized Nystr\u00f6m approximation, random pivoted Cholesky and greedy pivoted Cholesky. We demonstrate the performance of our method on two applications: thin liquid film dynamics and sea surface temperature.",

In comparison, dimension reduction rules for overlapping group sparsity are generally less developed because the subgradient structure is more complex, making the link between sparsity pattern and the dual variable indirect due to the non-separability. In this work, we propose new dual certificates for overlapping group sparsity and a novel adaptive scheme for identifying the support of the overlapping group LASSO. We demonstrate how this scheme can be integrated into and significantly accelerate existing algorithms, including Primal-Dual splitting method, alternating direction method of multipliers and a recently developed variable projection scheme based on over-parameterization.

    "abstract": "Platelet extraction requires whole blood to be processed within six hours of donation. To meet this deadline, blood collection organizations must optimally route a fleet of vehicles to pick up blood units from donation sites and deliver them to a processing center. This paper introduces a drone-aided blood collection routing problem in which a fleet of trucks, each equipped with a drone, operates in a synchronized manner to collect blood units before their processing time limit expires. Each truck-drone tandem can perform multiple trips throughout the planning horizon, allowing donation sites to be visited repeatedly as new blood units become available over time. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer linear program that jointly optimizes the routing of trucks and drones, pickup schedules, and timing decisions to maximize the total number of viable blood units collected. We also develop a column generation approach that decomposes the problem into a master problem to select the optimal set of truck-drone tours and a pricing subproblem, which is solved using a tailored memetic algorithm to generate promising new columns. Through a comprehensive computational study, we show the operational benefits of integrating drones into the blood collection system. In addition, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm over Gurobi and two metaheuristics from the literature, namely the hybrid genetic algorithm and the invasive weed optimization, in both the drone-aided and truck-only settings.",

We first discover that a quadruple statistic over matchings corresponds to the well known quadruple statistic (exc,drop,fix,cyc) over permutations, where exc, drop, fix and cyc are the excedance, drop, fixed point and cycle statistics, respectively. By introducing matching permutations, we provide a symmetric expansion of a five-variable neighbor polynomial of matchings, which encodes a great deal of neighbor information. As an application, we discover the e-positivity of NCA-polynomials, which implies that the left-nesting number, the left-crossing number and the neighbor alignment number are distributed symmetrically over all matchings on [2n].

We develop a data-driven framework based on an extension of Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to systems with distributed memory, enabling discovery of transmission mechanisms directly from time series data. Using severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) as a case study, we show that this approach can uncover key features of tick-borne disease dynamics using only human incidence and local temperature data, without imposing predefined assumptions on human case reporting. We further demonstrate that predictive performance is substantially enhanced when the data-driven model is coupled with mechanistic representations of tick-host transmission pathways informed by empirical studies. The framework supports systematic sensitivity analysis of memory kernels and behavioral parameters, identifying those most influential for prediction accuracy. Although the approach prioritizes predictive accuracy over mechanistic transparency, it yields sparse, interpretable integral representations suitable for epidemiological forecasting. This hybrid methodology provides a scalable strategy for forecasting vector-borne disease risk and informing public health decision-making under data limitations.",

    "title": "Quantitative synthetic aperture radar inversion",
    "abstract": "We study an inverse scattering problem for monostatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR): Estimate the wave speed in a heterogeneous, isotropic and nonmagnetic medium probed by waves emitted and measured by a moving antenna. The forward map, from the wave speed to the measurements, is derived from Maxwell's equations. It is a nonlinear map that accounts for multiple scattering and it is very oscillatory at high frequencies. This makes the standard, nonlinear least squares data fitting formulation of the inverse problem difficult to solve. We introduce an alternative, two-step approach: The first step computes the nonlinear map from the measurements to an approximation of the electric field inside the unknown medium aka, the internal wave. This is done for each antenna location in a non-iterative manner.\n  The internal wave fits the data by construction, but it does not solve Maxwell's equations. The second step uses optimization to minimize the discrepancy between the internal wave and the solution of Maxwell's equations, for all antenna locations. The optimization is iterative. The first step defines an imaging function whose computational cost is comparable to that of standard SAR imaging, but it gives a better estimate of the support of targets. Further iterations improve the quantitative estimation of the wave speed. We assess the performance of the method with numerical simulations and compare the results with those of standard inversion.",

    "title": "Lipschitz regularity of harmonic map heat flows into $CAT(0)$ spaces",
    "abstract": "In 1964, Eells and Sampson proved the famous long-time existence and convergence for the harmonic map heat flow into non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds. Subsequently, Hamilton investigated the corresponding initial-boundary problem. In 1992, Gromov and Schoen developed a variational theory of harmonic maps into $CAT(0)$ metric spaces. This progress naturally motivated the study of the harmonic map heat flow into singular metric spaces.\n  In the 1990s, Mayer and Jost independently studied convex functionals on $CAT(0)$ spaces and extended Crandall-Liggett's theory of gradient flows from Banach spaces to $CAT(0)$ spaces to obtain the weak solutions, called semi-group weak solutions, for the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces. Very recently, Lin, Segatti, Sire, and Wang used an elliptic approximation method to obtain another class of weak solutions, called suitable weak solutions in the sense of the Evolution Variational Inequality (EVI), to the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces. They proved that these solutions are Lipschitz in space and $\\frac{1}{2}$-H\u00f6lder continuous in time.\n  Since the semi-group weak solutions of the harmonic map heat flow enjoy the favorable long-time existence, uniqueness and well established long-time behaviors, it is natural to ask if the semi-group solutions possess the Lipschitz regularity. In the present paper, we answer this question. We show that the semi-group weak solutions of the harmonic map heat flow into CAT(0) spaces are Lipschitz continuous in both space and time. We also establish an Eells-Sampson-type Bochner inequality.",

    "abstract": "The Reynolds equation is derived from the incompressible Navier Stokes equations under the lubrication assumptions of a long and thin domain geometry and a small scaled Reynolds number. The Reynolds equation is an elliptic differential equation and a dramatic simplification from the governing equations. When the fluid domain is piecewise linear, the Reynolds equation has an exact solution that we formulate by coupling the exact solutions of each piecewise component. We consider a formulation specifically for piecewise constant heights, and a more general formulation for piecewise linear heights; in both cases the linear system is inverted using the Schur complement. These methods can also be applied in the case of non-linear heights by approximating the height as piecewise constant or piecewise linear, in which case the methods achieve second order accuracy. We assess the time complexity of the two methods, and determine that the method for piecewise linear heights is linear time for the number of piecewise components. As an application of these methods, we explore the limits of validity for lubrication theory by comparing the solutions of the Reynolds and the Stokes equations for a variety of linear and non-linear textured slider geometries.",

We study the convergence of the linear solver in dependence on the number of subdomains and the number of element of the coarse grid. We propose a simplified cost model measuring the computational costs in terms of floating-point operations, the speed of computation, and the wall-clock time for communications among computer cores. Moreover, the cost model serves as a base of the presented adaptive domain decomposition method which chooses the number of subdomains and the number of element of the coarse grid in order to minimize the computational costs.

We explain the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon through a concise mathematical argument. This observation has direct implications for estimating random propagation effects such as fading, particularly when reflections off walls are involved.\n  Motivated by understanding intelligent surfaces, we apply this fundamental result to a physical model consisting of a single transmitter between two parallel passive walls. We analyze signal fading due to reflections and observe power oscillations resulting from wall reflections -- a phenomenon long studied in waveguides but relatively unexplored in wireless networks. For the special case where the transmitter is placed halfway between the walls, we present a compact closed-form expression for the received signal involving the Lerch transcendent function.

The result in (i) shows that the zero eigenvalue arising from translation invariance is embedded in the essential spectrum. Consequently, the standard Evans function approach cannot be applied directly to prove (iii). To resolve this, we employ an Evans-function framework that extends into regions of the essential spectrum, thereby enabling us to compute the derivative of the Evans function at the origin. Our result establishes that this derivative admits a factorization into two factors: one associated with transversality of the connecting profile and the other with hyperbolic stability of the corresponding shock of the quasi-neutral Euler system. We further show that both factors are nonzero, which implies simplicity of the zero eigenvalue.",

It is well known that if the eavesdropper experiences less channel noise than the legitimate receiver, then it is impossible for the transmitter to achieve positive secrecy rates. A known solution to this issue consists in involving a second transmitter, referred to as a helper, to help the first transmitter to achieve security. While such a solution has been studied for the asymptotic blocklength regime and via non-constructive coding schemes, in this paper, for the first time, we design explicit and short blocklength codes using deep learning and cryptographic tools to demonstrate the benefit and practicality of cooperation between two transmitters over the wiretap channel. Specifically, our proposed codes show strict improvement in terms of information leakage compared to existing codes that do not consider a helper. Our code design approach relies on a reliability layer, implemented with an autoencoder architecture based on the successive interference cancellation method, and a security layer implemented with universal hash functions. We also propose an alternative autoencoder architecture that significantly reduces training time by allowing the decoders to independently estimate messages without successively canceling interference by the receiver during training. Additionally, we show that our code design is also applicable to the multiple access wiretap channel with helpers, where two transmitters send confidential messages to the legitimate receiver.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation offers robust performance in high-mobility scenarios by transforming time-varying channels into the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, in high-mobility environment such as emerging 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), the extreme orbital velocities of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites frequently cause the physical Doppler shifts to exceed the fundamental grid range. This Doppler ambiguity induces severe model mismatch and renders traditional MLE channel estimators ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel low-complexity pilot-aided Doppler ambiguity detection and compensation framework. We first mathematically derive the OTFS input-output relationship in the presence of aliasing, revealing that Doppler ambiguity manifests itself as a distinct phase rotation along the delay dimension. Leveraging this insight, we developed a two-stage estimator that utilizes pairwise phase differences between pilot symbols to identify the integer ambiguity, followed by a refined Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for channel recovery. We investigate two pilot arrangements, Embedded Pilot with Guard Zone (EP-GZ) and Data-Surrounded Pilot (DSP), to analyze the trade-off between interference suppression and spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively eliminates the error floor caused by ambiguity, achieving Bit Error Rate (BER) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) performance comparable to the exhaustive search benchmark while maintaining a computational complexity similar to standard MLE.",

Inequality constraints are partitioned into two subsets: one treated via a logarithmic barrier applied to an aggregated interior constraint violation, and the other handled through an exterior quadratic penalty. All equality constraints are treated by the exterior penalty. A merit function defines a sequence of unconstrained subproblems, which are solved approximately using MADS, while a carefully designed update rule drives the penalty-barrier parameter to zero. In the nonsmooth setting, we establish convergence results ensuring feasibility for general constraints as well as Clarke stationarity for inequality-constrained problems. Computational experiments on both analytical test sets and challenging blackbox problems demonstrate that the proposed MADS-PIP algorithm is competitive with, and often outperforms, MADS with the progressive barrier strategy, particularly in the presence of equality constraints.",

    "abstract": "For any $\u03bd\\in(\\frac 37,\\frac12)$, we prove the existence of an $H^1$ solution $u$ of the mass critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation on the time interval $(0,T_0]$, for some $T_0>0$, which blows up at the time $t=0$ and at the point $x=0$ with the rate $\\|\\partial_x u (t,x)\\|_{L^2} \\approx t^{-\u03bd}$. Such a blowup rate is associated to a blowup residue of the form $r_\u03b1(x)= x^{\u03b1-\\frac 12}$ for $x>0$ close to the blowup point, where $\u03b1=\\frac{3\u03bd-1}{2-4\u03bd}$. The condition $\u03bd\\in(\\frac37,\\frac12)$ is equivalent to $\u03b1>1$, which corresponds to the full range for which the residue $r_\u03b1$ belongs to $H^1$.\n  Such blowup at a finite point is in contrast with all the blowup solutions constructed for this equation, except the one constructed previously by the authors corresponding to the special value $\u03bd=\\frac 25$.\n  Finally, we present some open problems regarding the blowup phenomenon for the mass critical gKdV equation.",
