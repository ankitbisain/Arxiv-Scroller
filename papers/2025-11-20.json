    "abstract": "We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for orbits of certain unipotent subgroups in arithmetic quotients of semisimple Lie groups with a polynomial error term. This provides the first infinite family of examples where effective equidistribution, with polynomial error rate, of non-horospherical unipotent subgroups in semisimple quotients is obtained.\n  As applications, we obtain effective estimate on distribution of lattice orbits on homogeneous spaces, as well as an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms with a polynomial error rate in all dimension $d \\geq 3$. We also prove a sub-modularity inequality for irreducible representation of connected algebraic group, which is crucial to our proof and is of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "We consider an infinite-dimensional stochastic clustering model on $\\mathbb{R}$. In discrete time, each point of a unit-intensity simple point process moves halfway toward either of its left or right neighbors, chosen uniformly at random. Co-located points are merged into a single point, and the resulting simple point process is rescaled to unit intensity. We show that, when the point processes are shifted so that there is a point at the origin, there is a unique weak limit of these dynamics when the initial point process is renewal. We also conjecture that for the time-reversed process and with an appropriate scaling in space, there is a limiting (random) distribution function on $\\mathbb{R}$, whose corresponding measure assigns to $\\mathbb{R}$ a measure corresponding to the gap between consecutive points. Finally, we discuss some relevant research directions.",

Here, through analysis of simple but representative dynamical models -- exponential decay, harmonic oscillation, and chaos -- we demonstrate that model selection depends sensitively on sampling rate and system dimensionality. We derive explicit formulas predicting when standard information criteria fail that should be adaptable to many real-world scenarios, enabling experimentalists to design sampling protocols that avoid pathological regimes.",

    "abstract": "A classical result of Nosal asserts that every $m$-edge graph with spectral radius $\u03bb(G)> \\sqrt{m}$ contains a triangle. A celebrated extension of Nikiforov [35] states that if $G$ is an $m$-edge graph with $\u03bb(G)> \\sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, then $G$ contains a clique $K_{r+1}$. This result implies the Tur\u00e1n theorem and Wilf theorem, and offers a new perspective on the existence of substructures. The edge-spectral conditions are versatile for enforcing substructures, as they can be applied to any sparse graph regardless of its edge density. In this paper, we prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with chromatic number $\u03c7(F)=r+1\\ge 4$, if $m$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is an $F$-free graph with $m$ edges, then $\u03bb(G)\\le \\sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a regular complete $r$-partite graph. This settles an open problem proposed by Yu and Li [52] and also gives spectral bounds for graphs forbidding books and wheels.\n  Secondly, we establish an asymptotic formula and structural characterization when we forbid an almost-bipartite graph $F$, where $F$ is called almost-bipartite if it can be made bipartite by removing at most one edge. As applications, we determine the unique $m$-edge spectral extremal graph for every integer $m$ when avoiding certain substructures, including complete bipartite graphs plus an edge, cycles plus an edge, and theta graphs, etc. Our results resolve an open problem proposed by Li, Zhao and Zou [24], as well as two conjectures posed by Liu and Li [31]. The arguments in our proofs are based on the edge-spectral stability method recently established by the authors. In addition, we develop some new spectral techniques, including the stability result for the Perron--Frobenius eigenvector.",

The framework generalizes existing models, recovering the standard maximal and expected power constraints and the recent mean and variance constraint as special cases. Under certain growth and continuity assumptions on the functions, our main theorem gives an exact characterization of the minimum average error probability for Gaussian channels as a function of the first- and second-order coding rates. The converse proof reduces the code design problem to minimization over a compact (under the Prokhorov metric) set of probability distributions, characterizes the extreme points of this set and invokes the Bauer's maximization principle.",

    "abstract": "This document offers a concise introduction to the mathematical theory and practical application of the Hausdorff Measure and Dimension. The primary objective is to clarify and rigorously detail the two most common methods used for calculating the dimension of a set, ensuring all calculation details are transparent for the reader.\n  The paper first establishes the theoretical groundwork by reviewing the definitions of the Hausdorff measure, proving the dimensional invariance under changes to the shape of the covering sets, and confirming the dimensional property of open sets. It then introduces the two main methodologies.\n  The first is the Lower and Upper Bound Estimation, which uses the relationship between the measure $H^s(A)$ and the dimension $\\dim_{H}(A)$. This method emphasizes the use of the Mass Distribution Principle for establishing the lower bound, which is essential when the Lebesgue measure of the set is zero. The second, more computationally efficient method is the Similarity Dimension Method, introduced via the definitions of Similitudes, Iterated Function Systems (IFS), and the Moran-Hutchinson Theorem.\n  Both methodologies are applied rigorously to classic examples: the Unit Square (yielding dimension $2$) and the Cantor Set (yielding the fractional dimension $\\log 2 / \\log 3$). The paper serves as a detailed, step-by-step guide intended to make the application of these fundamental fractal geometry concepts clearer and easier to understand.",

We don't know of any such sharp and detailed description otherwise, which is our motivation to look for a new approach to the problem. The underlying idea is to describe solutions of Gelfand problems via suitably defined constrained problems of free boundary-type arising in plasma physics and to replace the usual $L^\\infty$ norm of the solution with the energy of the plasma. Toward this goal, we first solve a long standing open problem of independent interest about the uniqueness of solutions of Grad-Shafranov type equations. Thus, we exploit these unique solutions to detect a curve containing both minimal and non minimal solutions of the associated Gelfand problem. In other words we come up with a new global parametrization of the Rabinowitz continuum, the monotonicity of the energy along the branch providing a meaningful generalization of the classical pointwise monotonicity property of minimal solutions, suitable to describe non minimal solutions as well. On a ball in any dimension, we come up as expected with a bell-shaped profile of the full branch of solutions of the Gelfand problem.",

    "title": "Generalized Repetition Codes and Their Application to HARQ",
    "abstract": "The inherent uncertainty of communication channels implies that any coding scheme has a non-zero probability of failing to correct errors, making retransmission mechanisms essential. To ensure message reliability and integrity, a dual-layer redundancy framework is typically employed: error correction codes mitigate noise-induced impairments at the physical layer, while cyclic redundancy checks verify message integrity after decoding. Retransmission is initiated if verification fails. This operational model can be categorized into two types of repeated communication models: Type-I systems repeatedly transmit identical codewords, whereas Type-II systems transmit distinct coded representations of the same message. The core challenge lies in maximizing the probability of correct message decoding within a limited number of transmission rounds through verification-based feedback mechanisms.\n  In this paper, we consider a scenario where the same error-correcting code is used for repeated transmissions, and we specifically propose two classes of generalized repetition codes (GRCs), corresponding to the two repeated communication models. In contrast to classical theory, we regard GRCs as error-correcting codes under multiple metrics--that is, GRCs possess multiple minimum distances. This design enables GRCs to perform multi-round error correction under different metrics, achieving stronger error-correction capabilities than classical error-correcting codes. However, the special structure of GRCs makes their construction more challenging, as it requires simultaneously optimizing multiple minimum distances. To address this, we separately investigate the bounds and constructions for Type-I and Type-II GRCs, and obtain numerous optimal Type-I and Type-II GRCs.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem for continuous-time Markov Jump Linear Systems (MJLS) governed by general finite-state Markov chains that may include transient, absorbing, or non-communicating states. The problem, posed over a finite time horizon, is reformulated deterministically by expressing the cost functional in terms of a collection of second-moment matrices of the system state. A projection operator is introduced to restrict the analysis to the subspace of visited states, namely those with positive probability of being reached within the time horizon. The solution of the resulting deterministic problem is obtained from a reduced-order system of coupled matrix Riccati differential equations involving only the visited states, which define a quadratic value function satisfying a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type equation. The structure of this equation is formally justified in the matrix setting via the Riesz-Frechet representation theorem, establishing a rigorous foundation for the deterministic reformulation and resolving an open aspect in previous literature. Several numerical examples, including cases with non-communicating states, validate the theoretical results and illustrate the practical relevance of the proposed generalization.",

The characterization is based on polynomials in the entries of the H-matrix that we call H-invariants, whose values stay constant over all optimal H-matrices, together with H-certificates, of which nonnegativity precisely specifies the region of optimality within the common level set of H-invariants.

However, they face significant challenges in achieving reliable network coverage during transit operations. This paper provides an in-depth investigation into the characteristics and challenges of communication networks tailored for UAVs. First, we outline typical operational scenarios, traffic patterns, and a dual-layer heterogeneous network topology. This topology is essential for enabling three-dimensional continuous coverage and ensuring seamless network coexistence between UAVs and other network entities. Moreover, the paper delves into the channel characteristics and specific challenges faced by UAV Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) networks. It highlights the limitations of traditional Active Phased Array Antenna (APAA)-based networks, particularly regarding cost, complexity, and site deployment constraints. We then introduce Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted networks as a promising solution for enhancing UAV signal coverage. The key technical features of RIS are discussed, including design principles, antenna tilt configurations, new beam types, and beam tracking mechanisms. In addition, we examine the impact of highfrequency bands and their absorption peaks on signal attenuation. The paper further explores network architecture designs aimed at improving UAV signal coverage, facilitating network coexistence, and supporting RIS-enhanced UAV sensing. Field trial results evaluating the effectiveness of RIS in improving UAV coverage are presented. Finally, we outline future technological trends and highlight potential advancements to further optimize UAV communication systems.

In 2022, Ferber and Krivelevich resolved this conjecture affirmatively with $c=10^{-4}$. A natural question is to determine the largest possible constant $c$. In 1994, Caro remarked that if $2/7$ is a valid value for $c$, then it is the largest possible one. To the best of our knowledge, the bound $c\\ge 2/7$ has not been improved. Previous research has established tight bounds for specific graph classes -- for instance, $c = 2/5$ for graphs with maximum degree at most $3$ and without isolated vertices. In this paper, we prove that $c=2/7$ is the tight bound for graphs with maximum degree at most $4$ and without isolated vertices.

The goal is to determine a distribution on a bounded one-dimensional domain that maximizes the total population at equilibrium. Previous works have shown that optimal resources are bang-bang, and in one dimension, a sufficiently large dispersal rate forces the optimal resource to be concentrated. For general dispersal rates, however, the analysis becomes more difficult because the equilibrium population may behave irregularly, and the optimal resource may be fragmented. To address this, we introduce a block decomposition that reduces fragmented resources to a collection of concentrated blocks. We then define an advantage function, which measures the gain in the equilibrium population obtained by allocating resources on a fixed interval and is used to analyze the contribution of each block to the total population. This function also allows us to reformulate the optimization problem as a convexity analysis of the advantage function. We prove the superlinearity of this function when the total resource is small enough, and this property leads to an explicit characterization of the optimal control with sufficiently small total resource.",

While the unisolvence is a rather sparse topic, the conditioning in the unisolvent setting has a uniform behavior: as for the case of standard Vandermonde matrix-sequences with real nodes, the conditioning is inherently exponential as a function of $d$ when the monomial basis is chosen. In contrast, for an appropriate selection of supports, the Chebyshev basis of second kind has a bounded conditioning. A linear behavior is also observed in the Frobenius norm.",

When the function is produced by a spanning set of fractional power functions, traditional quadrature rules often need to be revised, failing to provide exact evaluations for fractional power functions and thus introducing approximation errors. In this paper, we have formulated a fractional quadrature rule that achieves exact integration for functions within this specific set to address this issue. Some properties of the fractional quadrature rule have been proved, and the absolute error bound in the proposed fractional quadrature rule has been derived. The behavior of roots of the orthogonal M\u00fcntz polynomial has also been observed for its application as nodes in the fractional quadrature rule. To illustrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed fractional quadrature rule, we focus on fractional differential equations that incorporate the left Caputo fractional derivative. In this context, M\u00fcntz-Legendre scaling functions are utilized to approximate the Caputo derivative of functions involved in these equations. Additionally, we have derived an operational matrix for Riemann-Liouville integration to approximate the respective functions with the help of the fractional quadrature rule. To demonstrate the practical utility of our method, we provide illustrative examples that compare the $L_2$-error estimates in the solutions of fractional differential equations using our approach against those obtained with the Block-pulse method.

Although it is known that $QAut_{Bic}(\u0393) \\cong QAut_{Bic}(\u0393^c)$ does not hold in general, we identify a family of graphs for which this isomorphism enforces that the graph has no quantum symmetry. Moreover, we describe a few families of graphs having quantum symmetries whose quantum automorphism groups in Bichon's sense are commutative. Finally, we show that free product, tensor product and free wreath product constructions can arise as Bichon's quantum automorphism groups of connected graphs in the following sense: For a finite family of compact matrix quantum groups $\\{Q_i\\}_{i=1}^{m}$ arising as Bichon's quantum automorphism groups of certain graphs, there exist connected graphs $\u0393_{free}$, $\u0393_{ten}$ and $\u0393_{wr}$ whose quantum automorphism groups are $*_{i=1}^{m} Q_{i}$, $\\otimes_{i=1}^{m} Q_i$ and $Q_1 \\wr_{*} Q_2$ respectively.",

    "abstract": "This report describes a new regularization approach based on segmentation of the forgetting profile in sliding window least squares estimation. Each segment is designed to enforce specific desirable properties of the estimator such as rapidity, desired condition number of the information matrix, accuracy, numerical stability, etc. The forgetting profile is divided in three segments, where the speed of estimation is ensured by the first segment, which employs rapid exponential forgetting of recent data.The second segment features a decline in the profile and marks the transition to the third segment, characterized by slow exponential forgetting to reduce the condition number of the information matrix using more distant data. Condition number reduction mitigates error propagation, thereby enhancing accuracy and stability. This approach facilitates the incorporation of a priori information regarding signal characteristics (i.e., the expected behavior of the signal) into the estimator. Recursive and computationally efficient algorithm with low rank updates based on new matrix inversion lemma for moving window associated with this regularization approach is developed. New algorithms significantly improve the approximation accuracy of low resolution daily temperature measurements obtained at the Stockholm Old Astronomical Observatory, thereby enhancing the reliability of temperature predictions.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem is addressed to reconstruct the unknown cost function underlying an observed optimal policy in a model-free manner, whose online adaptation with completely off-policy system data still remains unclear in the literature. Without prior knowledge of the system model parameters, an adaptive and direct learning rule for the cost parameter is proposed using online off-policy system data, which only needs to satisfy the mild persistently exciting condition in the general data-driven paradigm. The adaptive and online IRL algorithm is achieved by designing full Nesterov-Todd (NT)-step primal-dual interior-point iterations. Despite solving a nonlinear and time-varying semi-definite program (SDP), the influence of system noise is rigorously analyzed, and the proposed online algorithm is shown to achieve a sublinear convergence. The proposed method is further generalized to nonlinear IRL based on differential dynamic programming. The gradient of the loss function is directly obtained via a backward pass, which eliminates the need to repeatedly solve forward RL problems as in conventional bi-level IRL frameworks. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "In randomized experiments, regression adjustment leverages covariates to improve the precision of average treatment effect (ATE) estimation without requiring a correctly specified outcome model. Although well understood in low-dimensional settings, its behavior in high-dimensional regimes -- where the number of covariates $p$ may exceed the number of observations $n$ -- remains underexplored. Furthermore, existing theory is largely asymptotic, providing limited guidance for finite-sample inference. We develop a design-based, non-asymptotic analysis of the regression-adjusted ATE estimator under complete randomization. Specifically, we derive finite-sample-valid confidence intervals with explicit, instance-adaptive widths that remain informative even when $p > n$. These intervals rely on oracle (population-level) quantities, and we also outline data-driven envelopes that are computable from observed data. Our approach hinges on a refined swap sensitivity analysis: stochastic fluctuation is controlled via a variance-adaptive Doob martingale and Freedman's inequality, while design bias is bounded using Stein's method of exchangeable pairs. The analysis suggests how covariate geometry governs concentration and bias through leverages and cross-leverages, shedding light on when and how regression adjustment improves on the difference-in-means baseline.",

    "abstract": "We investigate string graphs through the lens of graph product structure theory, which describes complicated graphs as subgraphs of strong products of simpler building blocks. A graph $G$ is called a string graph if its vertices can be represented by a collection $\\mathcal{C}$ of continuous curves (called a string representation of $G$) in a surface so that two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if the corresponding curves in $\\mathcal{C}$ cross. We prove that every string graph with bounded maximum degree in a fixed surface is isomorphic to a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path. This extends recent product structure theorems for string graphs. Applications of this result are presented. This product structure theorem ceases to be true if the `bounded maximum degree' assumption is relaxed to `bounded degeneracy'. For string graphs in the plane, we give an alternative proof of this result. Specifically, we show that every string graph in the plane has a `localised' string representation where the number of crossing points on the curve representing a vertex $u$ is bounded by a function of the degree of $u$.\n  Our proof of the product structure theorem also leads to a result about the treewidth of outerstring graphs, which qualitatively extends a result of Fox and Pach [Eur. J. Comb. 2012] about outerstring graphs with bounded maximum degree. We extend our result to outerstring graphs defined in arbitrary surfaces.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a class of non-autonomous highly oscillatory ordinary differential equations (ODEs) featuring a linear component inversely proportional to a small parameter $\\varepsilon$ with purely imaginary eigenvalues, alongside an $\\varepsilon$-independent nonlinear component. When $0<\\varepsilon\\ll 1$, the rapidly oscillatory solution constrains the step size selection and numerical accuracy, resulting in significant computational challenges. Motivated by linearization through introducing auxiliary polynomial variables, a new class of explicit exponential integrators (EIs) has recently been developed. The methods do not require the linear part to be diagonal or with all eigenvalues to be integer multiples of a fixed value - a general assumption in multiscale methods - and attain arbitrarily high convergence order without any order conditions. The main contribution of this work is to establish a rigorous error analysis for the new class of methods. To do this, we first demonstrate the equivalence between the high-dimensional system and the original problem by employing algebraic techniques. Building upon these fundamental results, we prove that the numerical schemes have a uniform convergence order of $O(h^{k+1})$ for the solution when using at most $k$-degree auxiliary polynomial variables with time step sizes smaller than $\\varepsilon$. For larger step sizes under the bounded oscillatory energy condition, the methods achieve a convergence order of $O(\\varepsilon h^k)$ for the solution. These theoretical results are further applied to second-order oscillatory equations, yielding improved uniform accuracy with respect to $\\varepsilon$. Finally, numerical experiments confirm the optimality of the derived error estimates.",

In particular, a measure of quality for those PSSs is required to obtain complexity bounds for direct search.\n  In this paper, we derive complexity guarantees for a class of Riemannian direct-search techniques, and study two ways of generating positive spanning sets in tangent spaces. We pay particular attention the unit hypersphere case, for which we establish that generating directions directly within the tangent space leads to better complexity properties than projecting PSSs from the ambient space onto the tangent space.

Considering an appropriately scaled version of this model, we formally derive, as the corresponding mean-field limit, a system of Fokker-Planck equations, from which we subsequently derive, as a macroscopic model counterpart, a system of differential equations for the mean densities of muscle and immune cells in the cohort of patients and the related variances. Then, we study long-time asymptotics for the mean-field model by determining the quasi-equilibrium cell distribution functions, which are in the form of probability density functions of inverse Gamma distributions, and proving the long-time convergence to such quasi-equilibrium distributions. The analytical results obtained are illustrated by means of a sample of results of numerical simulations.

Generic perturbations generate diffusion waves, and structural conditions fail for multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in Eulerian coordinates. These two aspects have posed significant challenges and left the problem unresolved for years. On one hand, since \\cite{LX}, the study of the entropy wave has been based on the left-right structural conditions. Without these structural conditions, the decay rates of lower-order terms become too slow to close the {\\it a priori} assumption. On the other hand, the presence of diffusion waves yields problematic error terms in the perturbation system. In this work, we introduce a new transformation to ensure that both left-right structural conditions hold for the perturbation system. Additionally, using the fact that the derivative of the entropy wave maintains a fixed sign, we employ well-designed weighted energy estimates to control the slowly decaying terms. This enables us to establish asymptotic stability and derive the optimal decay rate. Furthermore, we address the case of initial perturbations with the zero mass condition and obtain the optimal decay rate by additionally developing a Poincar\u00e9 type inequality and a key cancellation.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel wave front tracking framework for reconstructing unknown flux functions in $2\\times 2$ hyperbolic conservation laws, extending beyond the well-studied scalar case. By analyzing Riemann solutions at fixed observation times, we develop explicit reconstruction formulas that handle arbitrary combinations of shock and rarefaction waves through a unified equivalent shock concept. Our method constructs piecewise quadratic $C^1$ flux approximations with rigorous convergence guarantees: the approximation errors decrease quadratically with the discretization parameters for function values and linearly for derivatives under $C^{1,1}$ regularity, with enhanced cubic and quadratic convergence respectively under $C^3$ regularity. Applications to the isentropic Euler equations and the mathematically equivalent p-system in compressible fluid dynamics demonstrate the method's capability to identify complete equations of state from limited dynamic measurements, providing a systematic approach to a fundamental inverse problem in continuum mechanics.",

    "title": "Mini-Extragradient Methods",
    "abstract": "The Extragradient (EG) method stands as a cornerstone algorithm for solving monotone nonlinear equations but faces two important unresolved challenges: (i) how to select stepsizes without relying on the global Lipschitz constant or expensive line-search procedures, and (ii) how to reduce the two full evaluations of the mapping required per iteration to effectively one, without compromising convergence guarantees or computational efficiency. To address the first challenge, we propose the Greedy Mini-Extragradient (Mini-EG) method, which updates only the coordinate associated with the dominant component of the mapping at each extragradient step. This design capitalizes on componentwise Lipschitz constants that are far easier to estimate than the classical global Lipschitz constant. To further lower computational cost, we introduce a Random Mini-EG variant that replaces full mapping evaluations by sampling only a single coordinate per extragradient step. Although this resolves the second challenge from a theoretical standpoint, its practical efficiency remains limited. To bridge this gap, we develop the Watchdog-Max strategy, motivated by the slow decay of dominant component magnitudes. Instead of evaluating the full mapping, Watchdog-Max identifies and tracks only two coordinates at each extragradient step, dramatically reducing per-iteration cost while retaining strong practical performance. We establish convergence guarantees and rate analyses for all proposed methods. In particular, Greedy Mini-EG achieves enhanced convergence rates that surpass the classical guarantees of the vanilla EG method in several standard application settings. Numerical experiments on regularized decentralized logistic regression and compressed sensing show speedups exceeding $13\\times$ compared with the classical EG method on both synthetic and real datasets.",

Examples for $n=2$ are the closures of the Koch snowflake domain and the Gosper island domain. Our first result is that $\u03a9$ is thick in the sense of Triebel. A consequence is that $C_0^\\infty(\u03a9)$ is dense in the Sobolev space $H^s_\u0393:= \\{\u03c6\\in H^s(\\mathbb{R}^n): \\mathrm{supp}(\u03c6)\\subset \u0393\\}$ for all $s\\in\\mathbb{R}$.

Using our density result we prove that the standard PDE formulation of this problem is equivalent to the standard first kind boundary integral equation in which the boundary condition is imposed by restriction to the (relative) interior of the screen. To solve this equation we consider a piecewise-constant Galerkin boundary element method on a fractal mesh, and, using our best approximation error estimates, we prove convergence rates for the Galerkin approximation.",

The analysis shows the structure of a perturbed Euler-type model for the solution's macroscopic quantities: density, bulk velocity, and temperature, near the steady state, which gives a potential application to investigate fluid limit problems.

In the statistical jet bundle $E=\\mathbb{R}\\times L^2(\u03bc)$, we point out that the condition for an estimator error to lie in the span of derivatives of $s_\u03b8$ up to order $m$ is equivalent to the square root map satisfying a linear differential equation of order~$m$. The corresponding submanifold of $J^m(E)$ defined by this equation represents the locus of $m$-th order efficient models, and the prolonged section must form an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field. This establishes a one-to-one correspondence between algebraic projection conditions underlying CRB and Bhattacharyya-type bounds and geometric integrability conditions for the statistical section in the jet bundle hierarchy.

In their classical work (Lou-Ni, 1999), it was shown that, under the limit where one cross-diffusion parameter tends to infinity, coexistence steady states of the SKT model are characterized by three types of shadow systems. In a previous study (Kuto, 2015), the first author analyzed one of these shadow systems in one space dimension (the second shadow system) and proved that a component of a bifurcating branch blows up as the bifurcation parameter approaches the first positive Neumann eigenvalue of $-\u0394$. In the present paper, using a new approach based on suitable transformations and the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method, we derive the existence and detailed asymptotic structure of several branches of positive steady states near blow-up points for shadow systems with one or two cross-diffusion terms, in both one- and multi-dimensional domains. We further show that all such large-amplitude steady state branches are spectrally unstable.

    "abstract": "We study linear time-invariant Dissipative Hamiltonian (DH) systems arising in energy-based modeling of dynamical systems. An advantage of DH systems is that they are always stable due to the structure of their coefficient matrices, and, under further weak conditions, even asymptotically stable. In this paper, we discuss the computation of the stability radii for a given asymptotically stable DH system; i.e., the smallest structured perturbation that puts a DH system on the boundary of the region of asymptotic stability, so that it has purely imaginary eigenvalues. We obtain explicit computable formulas for various structured stability radii. For this, the problem of computing stability radii is reformulated in terms of minimizing the Rayleigh quotient of a Hermitian matrix or the sum of two generalized Rayleigh quotients of Hermitian semidefinite matrices. This reformulation results in the problem of minimizing the largest eigenvalue of an eigenvector-dependent Hermitian matrix or minimizing the smallest eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix which depends on the eigenvector. It is also demonstrated (via numerical experiments) that, under structure-preserving perturbations, the asymptotic stability of a DH system is much more robust than under general perturbations, since the distance to instability is typically much larger when structure-preserving perturbations are considered. Finally, similar results are obtained for optimally robust representations of stable systems.",

In the reflexive case, we study generalised pythagorean inequality, as well as norm-to-norm, uniform, and Lipschitz--H\u00f6lder continuity of entropic projections, proximal maps, and resolvents. We also provide a detailed account of the family of Va\u012dnberg--Br\u00e8gman geometries that are naturally encoding the geometric properties of the underlying Banach space norm. The extended theory belongs to the intersection of convex theoretic and homeomorphic approaches to nonlinear analysis. Its models are constructed using integration theory on order unit spaces. Our main focus is on geometry of, and nonlinear quasinonexpansive operators on, normal state spaces of JBW- and W*-algebras, modelled via nonlinear embeddings into reflexive rearrangement invariant spaces. For example, we analyse the extended Va\u012dnberg--Br\u00e8gman geometries induced by norm geometry of noncommutative and nonassociative L$_p$ spaces via Mazur embeddings, providing sufficient conditions for monoidal composability of extended quasinonexpansive operators, and computing the exponent parameters of Lipschitz--H\u00f6lder continuity of the corresponding extended entropic projections and resolvents. Other models feature the (commutative and noncommutative) Lozanovski\u012d factorisation map, generalised spin factors, finite dimensional base normed spaces, and convex spectral functions on unitarily invariant ideals of compact operators. We also discuss several categories of entropic projections and quasinonexpansive operators naturally appearing in this framework.",

We provide fundamental properties of the $\u03ba^+$-Borel hierarchy of any regular Hausdorff space of weight at most $\u03ba$, and establish sufficient conditions for its non-collapse. We highlight a unique phenomenon that arises in the case of singular cardinals, namely, the existence of a second, distinct Borel hierarchy, the $\u03ba$-Borel hierarchy: we prove that it is strictly finer than the $\u03ba^+$-Borel hierarchy, and then characterize the precise relationship between the two.

    "title": "Convergence and Sketching-Based Efficient Computation of Neural Tangent Kernel Weights in Physics-Based Loss",
    "abstract": "In multi-objective optimization, multiple loss terms are weighted and added together to form a single objective. These weights are chosen to properly balance the competing losses according to some meta-goal. For example, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), these weights are often adaptively chosen to improve the network's generalization error. A popular choice of adaptive weights is based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of the PINN, which describes the evolution of the network in predictor space during training. The convergence of such an adaptive weighting algorithm is not clear a priori. Moreover, these NTK-based weights would be updated frequently during training, further increasing the computational burden of the learning process. In this paper, we prove that under appropriate conditions, gradient descent enhanced with adaptive NTK-based weights is convergent in a suitable sense. We then address the problem of computational efficiency by developing a randomized algorithm inspired by a predictor-corrector approach and matrix sketching, which produces unbiased estimates of the NTK up to an arbitrarily small discretization error. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and to show the efficacy of our randomized algorithm. Code Availability: https://github.com/maxhirsch/Efficient-NTK",

This classical result coined the term Tchakaloff quadrature for quadrature that is exact and only uses non-negative weights. It has been a long-standing endeavor, under which conditions such rules exist. A final answer was given in 2012 by Bisgaard with the insight that, in fact, every finite-dimensional space of integrable functions on a positive measure space admits them. In this article we recall this result and provide a major extension to the question of positive discretizability of $\\mathbb{C}$-linear functionals on finite-dimensional spaces. We introduce the notion of strict $S$-positivity for such functionals, where $S$ are subsets of the functional's domain, and show the equivalence of positive discretizability to being strictly $S$-positive for a suitable choice of $S$. We further investigate consequences for other discretization problems. One fundamental implication is the guaranteed existence of $L_p$-Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund equalities in finite-dimensional spaces of $p$-integrable functions in case that $p$ is an even integer, another the exact discretizability of any frame in $\\mathbb{K}^n$, where $\\mathbb{K}\\in\\{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{C}\\}$, if a rescaling of the frame elements is allowed.

For example, if $(n_k)_{k \\ge 1}$ is a sequence of integers satisfying the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1}/n_k\\ge q > 1,~k \\ge 1$, then the normalized sums $\\sum_{n=1}^N \\cos(2\u03c0n_k x)$, considered on the probability space $[0,1]$ with Borel $\u03c3$-field and Lebesgue measure, satisfy the central limit theorem (CLT) and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Remarkably, the situation becomes much more deliacate when the trigonometric function $\\cos(2 \u03c0x)$ is replaced by a more general 1-periodic function $f$, and fine arithmetic properties of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \\ge 1}$ come into play. The most relevant arithmetic property can be phrased in terms of the number of solutions of certain 2-variable Diophantine equations. Recently, the authors proved that the validity of the LIL requires a strictly stronger Diophantine criterion than the CLT. In the present paper we show that this is only a special case of a wide-ranging general principle: there is a sharp cutoff, which can be expressed in form of a Diophantine criterion on the sequence $(n_k)_{k \\ge 1}$, at which the tail probabilities of $\\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x)$ change from Gaussian to potentially erratic behavior. More precisely, let $L(N,a,b,c)$ be the number of solutions $(k,\\ell)$ of the equation $a n_k - b n_\\ell= c$, where $1\\leq k,\\ell \\leq N$. Roughly speaking, we prove: if $L(N,a,b,c) \\le N / g_N$ for some $g_N$, then $\\mathbb{P} \\left[\\sum_{k=1}^N f(n_k x) > t \\|f\\|_2 \\sqrt{N} \\right]$ is asymptotically is accordance with standard normal behavior for all $t$ up to $\\sqrt{2 \\log g_N}$.

    "title": "Communication-Pipelined Split Federated Learning for Foundation Model Fine-Tuning in UAV Networks",
    "abstract": "Deploying foundation models (FMs) on uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) promises broad ``low-altitude economy'' applications. Split federated learning (SFL)-based fine-tuning leverages distributed data while keeping raw data local and reduces client-side burden by partitioning the model between client and server. However, the per-round training latency is dominated by stragglers. Training paradigms featuring parallel gradient transmission (GT) allocate dedicated portions of downlink communication resources to each client. They may leave resources idle and suffer from prolonged GT latency, especially in UAV networks, where the communication latency typically far exceeds the computation latency. To address this, we propose a sequential GT paradigm, where the server dedicates all downlink resources for the current GT. We further propose communication-pipelined SFL (CPSFL), characterized by downlink GT priority scheduling and intra-round asynchronous training. We investigate CPSFL-based LoRA fine-tuning of FMs in UAV networks and formulate an optimization problem to minimize a weighted sum of per-round training latency and worst-case client energy consumption by optimizing the split point selection (SPS) and the computing and communication resource allocation (CCRA) (the uplink bandwidth allocation and the server computing frequency allocation). To solve this problem, we develop an attention-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, where the base station agent decides the split point and the CCRA in each round by leveraging previous round information, including UAV trajectories. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based CPSFL scheme outperforms the parallel GT benchmarks, the ablation variants, the fixed CCRA scheme, while approaching the best fixed-SPS scheme.",

By viewing diffusion as a noisy information channel, we measure how mutual information about set membership decays over time. This decay rate is shown to be determined by the boundary measure of the set, leading to a new proof of the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality with its sharp constant. The method extends to Riemannian manifolds satisfying curvature-dimension conditions, yielding Levy-Gromov and Gaussian isoperimetric results within a single analytic principle. Quantitative and stability bounds follow from refined entropy inequalities linking information loss to geometric rigidity. The approach connects geometric analysis and information theory, revealing how entropy dissipation encodes the geometry of diffusion and boundary.",

Leveraging IB theory, our approach enables an optimal end-to-end joint training of device and network models, in terms of the maximal task execution accuracy as well as the minimal communication overhead, through optimizing the trade-off hyperparameter. To address computational intractability in high-dimensional IB optimization, a tractable variational upper-bound approximation is derived. Unlike conventional grid or random search methods that require multiple training rounds with substantial computational costs, Hyper-VIB introduces a hypernetwork that generates approximately optimal DNN parameters for different values of the hyperparameter within a single training phase. Theoretical analysis in the linear case validates the hypernetwork design. Experimental results demonstrate our Hyper-VIB's superior accuracy and training efficiency over conventional VIB approaches in both classification and regression tasks.",

Our approach ensures that all system trajectories remain within a specified admissible set and converge to equilibrium in a predefined time despite adversarial disturbances. The control problem is formulated as a two-player zero-sum differential game, where the controller is a minimizing player and the adversary a maximizing player. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a saddle-point solution and safe predefined-time stability using a barrier Lyapunov function that satisfies a differential inequality and the steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation. To address the analytical intractability of solving the HJI equation, we introduce a physics-informed learning algorithm that robustly learns the Nash safely predefined-time stabilizing control strategy.

    "abstract": "Even though Plato's philosophy in ancient times was always closely associated with mathematics, modern Platonic scholarship, during the last five centuries, has moved steadily toward de-mathematization. The present work aims to outline a radical re-interpretation of Plato's philosophy, according to which the Platonic Idea, that is, the intelligible Being, has the structure of the philosophical analogue of a geometric dyad in a philosophic anthyphaeresis -- the precursor of modern continued fractions -- which was studied by the Pythagoreans, Theodorus and Theaetetus in relation with the discoveries of quadratic incommensurabilities. This mathematical structure is clearly visible in the Platonic method of Division and Collection, equivalently Name and Logos, equivalently True Opinion plus Logos, in the dialogues Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Meno, and Parmenides. Equipped with this structure of an intelligible Being, we provide definitive answers to fundamental questions, that were not be resolved by Platonists, concerning the following topics: the dialectic numbers, which are based on the anthyphairetic periodicity and the plus one rule, stating that the dialectic number of terms of a sequence is the (number of) ratios of successive terms plus one (stated in the Parmenides 148d-149d); the description of the intelligible being as an Indivisible Line, a statement bordering on the contradictory; the also seemingly contradictory Sophist 's statement that ``the not-Being is a Being'', based on the equalization of the two elements of the dyad defining an intelligible Being; the more general self-similar Oneness of an intelligible Being, based on the equalization of all parts generated by the anthyphairetic division of an intelligible Being; and finally the Third Man Argument in the Introduction to the Parmenides, appearing as a threat for Plato's theory, but essentially innocuous because of the self-similar Oneness. The third part of our study aims to prove that, contrary to the presently dominant interpretation of Zeno's arguments and paradoxes as being devoid of mathematical content, the analysis of Zeno's presence in the Parmenides, Sophist (via the Eleatic Stranger), and Zeno's verbatim Fragments preserved by Simplicius, show that Plato's intelligible Beings essentially coincide with Zeno's true Beings, and hence that Zeno's philosophical thought was already anthyphairetic, and hence heavily influenced by the Pythagorean's Mathematics. These findings run against Burkert's claim that ``ontology is prior to mathematics''. Modern Platonists have never obtained a clear description of the structure of an intelligible Idea in terms of the mathematics of periodic anthyphairesis, and thus were not able to answer fundamental questions, nor to realize the close connection of Zeno's intelligible beings with Zeno's true Beings.",

While previous work has linked DDI to instability in the purely nondiffusive subsystem -- thereby destabilizing all regular Turing patterns -- we show that DDI can also arise from subsystems involving nondiffusive and slow-diffusive components. This leads to simple sufficient conditions for DDI in systems with arbitrary numbers of components. Further, we fully classify all possible sources of DDI in the case of two diffusive and one nondiffusive component, illustrating our results with a receptor-based model supported by numerical bifurcation analysis and simulations. These findings extend the theoretical foundations of pattern formation, demonstrating how coupling between diffusive and nondiffusive dynamics can generate patterns beyond the reach of the classical reaction-diffusion framework.",

    "abstract": "Accurately simulating wave propagation is crucial in fields such as acoustics, electromagnetism, and seismic analysis. Traditional numerical methods, like finite difference and finite element approaches, are widely used to solve governing partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the Helmholtz equation. However, these methods face significant computational challenges when applied to high-frequency wave problems in complex two-dimensional domains. This work investigates Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs) and their multilevel extensions as a promising alternative. These methods leverage domain decomposition, partitioning the computational domain into overlapping sub-domains, each governed by a local neural network. We assess their accuracy and computational efficiency in solving the Helmholtz equation for the homogeneous case, demonstrating their potential to mitigate the limitations of traditional approaches.",

We analyze the problem of splitting off a free rank one summand from $\\mathscr{E}$ in corank $0$ and $1$. The problem in corank $0$ can be viewed as the search for a real analog of Murthy's celebrating splitting theorem in the algebraically closed case: to wit, beyond the vanishing of the top Chern class in Chow theory, are the obstructions to splitting ``purely topological''? In a sense, the answer in this case is yes, and we give a proof, using motivic techniques, of a mild extension of the results of Bhatwadekar-Sridharan and Bhatwadekar-Das-Mandal.\n  In corank $1$, in the algebraically closed situation, Murthy's splitting conjecture (now a theorem in characteristic $0$) predicts that the vanishing of the top Chern class in Chow theory is the only obstruction to splitting off a free rank $1$ summand, and we can search for a suitable ``real'' analog of this assertion. We observe that several natural guesses for a ``real'' analog of Murthy's splitting conjecture cannot be true, i.e., that the situation over the real numbers is rather complicated.",

This model captures nonlinear ultrasonic wave propagation in biological media and accounts for the experimentally observed power-law attenuation. We begin by extending the existing well-posedness theory for time-fractional equations to include inhomogeneous Neumann boundary data used as control inputs, which requires constructing an appropriate data extension and regularization. Using these analytical results for the forward problem, we prove the existence of globally optimal controls and analyze the stability of the optimization problem with respect to perturbations in the target pressure field and to vanishing regularization parameters.

    "abstract": "The investigation of legal judgment prediction (LJP), such as sentencing prediction, has attracted broad attention for its potential to promote judicial fairness, making the accuracy and reliability of its computation result an increasingly critical concern. In view of this, we present a new sentencing model that shares both legal logic interpretability and strong prediction capability by introducing a two-stage learning algorithm. Specifically, we first construct a hybrid model that synthesizes a mechanism model based on the main factors for sentencing with a neural network modeling possible uncertain features. We then propose a two-stage learning algorithm: First, an adaptive stochastic gradient (ASG) algorithm is used to get good estimates for the unknown parameters in the mechanistic component of the hybrid model. Then, the Adam optimizer tunes all parameters to enhance the predictive performance of the entire hybrid model. The asymptotic convergence of the ASG-based adaptive predictor is established without requiring any excitation data conditions, thereby providing a good initial parameter estimate for prediction. Based on this, the fast-converging Adam optimizer further refines the parameters to enhance overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset of intentional injury cases in China show that our new hybrid model combined with our two-stage ASG-Adam algorithm, outperforms the existing related methods in sentencing prediction performance, including those based on neural networks and saturated mechanism models.",

Theoretical studies of lossy compression indicate that high-rate common randomness between the compressor and the decompressor is a valuable resource for achieving realism. On the other hand, the utility of significant amounts of common randomness has not been noted in practice. We offer an explanation for this discrepancy by considering a realism constraint that requires satisfying a universal critic that inspects realizations of individual compressed reconstructions, or batches thereof. We characterize the optimal rate-distortion trade-off under such a realism constraint, and show that it is asymptotically achievable without any common randomness, unless the batch size is impractically large.",

Let $\\boldsymbol{Z} = (Y_{\u03c3(i)})_i$ denote the shuffled sequence produced by a uniformly random permutation $\u03c3$, and let $K = \u03c3^{-1}(1)$ represent the position of user 1's message after shuffling.\n  For the shuffle-only setting, we focus on a tractable yet expressive \\emph{basic configuration}, where the target user's message follows $Y_1 \\sim P$ and the remaining users' messages are i.i.d.\\ samples from $Q$, i.e., $Y_2,\\dots,Y_n \\sim Q$.

Power flow controllers (PFCs) that adjust effective line reactances to redistribute flows are often viewed as an interim solution to improve transmission network utilization. Traditional flexibility metrics and analysis approaches for PFCs focus on a limited number of operating points and contingencies. Towards gaining system-wide insights, this paper introduces a framework to quantify network flow controllability- the extent to which line flows can be reshaped through reactance adjustments. We derive analytical results demonstrating that installing PFCs on all lines enables complete controllability of feasible flow patterns. Building on these, we conduct empirical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system to examine how controllability varies with the number of PFCs and their reactance adjustment range. These analyses employ a mixed-integer linear program to optimize the siting and sizing of PFCs. Finally, we validate findings under AC power flow physics using an optimization routine that steers flows toward desired setpoints.",

Mathematically, this corresponds to recovering the coefficients of a damped wave operator, or equivalently, a quadratic operator pencil in the frequency domain.\n  The Lippmann-Schwinger equation maps the unknown reflectivity and loss distribution to the measured scattered data. This mapping is nonlinear, as it requires knowledge of the internal wavefield, which itself depends on the reflectivity and loss distribution. The Lippmann-Schwinger-Lanczos method addresses this nonlinearity by approximating the internal solutions through the lifting of states from a reduced-order model constructed directly from the measured data.\n  In this work, we extend the method to dissipative problems, enabling the approximation of internal partial differential equation (PDE) solutions in media with both reflectivity and loss distributions. We present two complementary constructions of such internal solutions: one based on spectral data and another on frequency-domain measurements over a finite interval. This development establishes a direct link between data-driven reduced-order models for inverse problems and port-Hamiltonian dynamical systems, with reduced models obtained either from the associated spectral measure or via rational approximation. Compared to the Born approximation, which replaces the internal field with the background field, our approach yields more accurate internal reconstructions and enables faster and more robust recovery of the contrast as evidenced by our numerical experiments.",

This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.",

    "abstract": "Let $C$ be a smooth projective absolutely irreducible curve of genus at least 2, defined over the rationals. For a number field $L$, let $C(L)_{new} = \\{P \\in C(L) : \\mathbb{Q}(P)=L\\}$. Let $n$ be at least 2. We conjecture that $C(L)_{new}$ is empty for 100 percent of degree $n$ number fields $L$ when ordered by absolute discriminant. We prove our conjecture for $n=3$ with $C$ any of the modular curves $X_0(23)$, $X_0(29)$, $X_0(31)$ and $X_0(64)$. Moreover, we prove the analogue of this conjecture for the unit equation, again with $n=3$.",
