    "abstract": "We extend sharp direct and inverse approximation statements for kernel-based methods for finitely smooth kernels, i.e. those whose native spaces are norm-equivalent to Sobolev spaces. In particular, our inverse results are now formulated for a broad class of approximation schemes beyond interpolation, extending existing theory. Building on these results, we propose a novel Sobolev Algorithm for Local Smoothness Analysis (SALSA) for detecting local smoothness properties of target data, including their degree of smoothness and non-smoothness. The method is rigorously grounded based on the sharp direct and inverse statements. Numerical experiments in various settings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "We extend the notion of an $H$-normal quotient digraph of an $H$-vertex-transitive digraph to that of an $H$-subnormal quotient digraph. Using these concepts, together with bipartite halves of bipartite digraphs, we show that, for each finite connected $H$-vertex-transitive, $(H,s)$-arc-transitive digraph with $s\\geqslant6$, either some $H$-normal quotient is a directed cycle of length at least $3$, or there is an $(L,t)$-arc-transitive digraph with $t\\geqslant (s-3)/2$, and $L$ a vertex-quasiprimitive almost simple group with socle a composition factor of $H$. This connection demonstrates that, to understand finite $s$-arc-transitive digraphs with large $s$, those admitting a vertex-quasiprimitive almost simple $s$-arc-transitive subgroup of automorphisms play a central role. We show that for each $s$ and each odd valency $k$, there are infinitely many $(H,s)$-arc-transitive digraphs of valency $k$ with $H$ a finite alternating group.\n  In addition we discovered a novel construction which takes as input a connected non-bipartite $H$-vertex-transitive, $(H,s)$-arc-transitive digraph, and outputs a connected bipartite $G$-vertex-transitive, $(G,2s)$-arc-transitive digraph with $G=(H\\times H).2$. This leads to construction of vertex-bi-quasiprimitive $s$-arc-transitive digraphs, for arbitrarily large $s$. Our investigations yield several new open problems.",

    "abstract": "We propose a unified theory of generalized weights for linear codes endowed with an arbitrary distance. Instead of relying on supports or anticodes, the weights of a code are defined via the intersections of the code with a chosen family of spaces, which we call a test family. The choice of test family determines the properties of the corresponding generalized weights and the characteristics of the code that they capture. In this general framework, we prove that generalized weights are weakly increasing and that certain subsequences are strictly increasing. We also prove a duality result reminiscent of Wei's Duality Theorem. The corresponding properties of generalized Hamming and rank-metric weights follow from our general results by selecting optimal anticodes as a test family. For sum-rank metric codes, we propose a test family that results in generalized weights that are closely connected to -- but not always the same as -- the usual generalized weights. This choice allows us to extend the known duality results for generalized sum-rank weights to some sum-rank-metric codes with a nonzero Hamming component. Finally, we explore a family of generalized weights obtained by intersecting the underlying code with MDS or MRD codes.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates surface polariton resonance (SPR) in three-dimensional elastic metamaterials with nanorod geometry. The primary motivation is to surpass the physical limitations imposed by the quasi-static approximation for SPRs through anisotropic geometric design. The analysis boils down to analyzing the spectral properties of the matrix-valued elastic Neumann-Poincar\u00e9 (NP) operator defined on the nanorod boundary. We develop novel analytical techniques and conduct a rigorous asymptotic analysis of elastic layer potential operators, specifically adapted for highly anisotropic structures. Within this framework, we derive precise asymptotic formulas for the scattered field in the quasi-static regime. A thorough examination of these expressions yields explicit resonance conditions that intricately link three fundamental parameters: elastic material parameters, wave frequency, and nanorod geometry. Furthermore, we characterize the intrinsic relationship between these parameters and the associated energy blow-up rate of the resonant field. This analysis explicitly establishes a sharp curvature concentration effect at the nanorod extremities, where field enhancement is locally maximized. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for harnessing elastic SPRs through anisotropic geometric engineering, with implications for sensing, wave focusing, and metamaterial applications.",

Unfortunately, in cases where the representation does not satisfy certain integrability conditions, one is faced with a bottleneck, namely that the discretization of the coorbit spaces is surprisingly difficult. It turns out that in these cases the construction of coorbit spaces as Fr\u00e9chet spaces is much more convenient since then atomic decompositions can be established in a very natural way.",

In Noetherian spaces, this condition is equivalent to preserving constructible subsets (Theorem 2.3), giving a topological characterization of Chevalley's theorem.

We establish basic properties of good maps and introduce a weaker variant, \\textit{weak good maps}. In algebraic geometry, affine space projections $\\mathbb{A}_{S}^{n}\\to S$ are good for any base scheme $S$ (Theorem 4.1).

    "abstract": "We prove a first inverse theorem for Gowers norms on all finite abelian groups that uses only nilmanifolds (rather than possibly more general nilspaces). This makes progress toward confirming the Jamneshan--Tao conjecture. The correlating function in our theorem is a projected nilsequence, obtained as the fiber-wise average of a nilsequence defined on a boundedly-larger abelian group extending the original abelian group. This result is tight in the following sense: we prove also that $k$-step projected nilsequences of bounded complexity are genuine obstructions to having small Gowers $U^{k+1}$-norm. This inverse theorem relies on a new result concerning compact finite-rank (CFR) nilspaces, which is the main contribution in this paper: every $k$-step CFR nilspace is a factor of a $k$-step nilmanifold. This new connection between the classical theory of nilmanifolds and the more recent theory of nilspaces has applications beyond arithmetic combinatorics. We illustrate this with an application in topological dynamics, by proving the following result making progress on a question of Jamneshan, Shalom and Tao: every minimal $\\mathbb{Z}^\u03c9$-system of order $k$ is a factor of an inverse limit of $\\mathbb{Z}^\u03c9$-polynomial orbit systems of order $k$, these being natural generalizations of nilsystems alternative to translational systems.",

Motivated by the classical no-slip paradox which states that the Navier-Stokes equations with a no-slip boundary condition require unphysical infinite dissipation during droplet spreading, we focus on the limit of vanishing slip. We show that in the no-slip limit three fundamentally different classes of limiting solutions are approached, each of them corresponding to a different scaling of the microscopic contact angle as the regularization parameter vanishes. These findings suggest that the thin-film equation with no slip supports a rich family of physically admissible solutions, provided one interprets the no-slip thin film equation as the asymptotic limit of models which regularized slip conditions. Even though the large apparent contact angles in some of these solutions seem incompatible with the lubrication approximation, a refined analysis shows that the underlying physical variables remain consistent with the assumptions for the lubrication approximation.",

We demonstrate that this classification does not hold in the real domain, where distinct equivalence classes can share identical spectral invariants.

Since there are no increasing functions from $\u03c9_1$ to $\\R$, the procedure must stop at some countable ordinal and existence is proved anyway.\n  The advantage of this line of reasoning is that it can be helpful even in situations where it is not so evident how to measure `being maximal' via a real valued function. This is the case, for instance, for existence of a Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development of an initial data set in General Relativity.\n  Speaking of this particular example, we also show that such `real-valued quantification' of the size of a development is actually possible, thus existence of a maximal one can be obtained in a countable number of steps using the original argument in [2] together with the standard procedure depicted above. This provides a way alternative to the one given in [5] to `dezornify' the proof in [2].",

Agents are characterized by their position, the angle determining their direction of motion, and their angular velocity. The dynamics combine features of the well-known Vicsek and Kuramoto models, which describe collective dynamics and synchronization, respectively. The evolution of the directions of motion follows a Vicsek model, where agents align their orientations with the mean orientation of their neighbors, subject to some noise. Similarly, the angular velocities relax towards the average angular velocity of the neighboring agents, also subject to noise. From the IBM we derive the corresponding kinetic equation in the limit of a large number of agents and formally obtain the macroscopic equations through a macroscopic (hydrodynamic) limit. Numerical simulations of the IBM reveal a variety of patterns, including rotating clusters, traveling orientation waves, and globally synchronized rotational motion. A qualitative comparison with simulations of the macroscopic system show the ability of the macroscopic model to reproduce some emergent behavior of the IBM.",

In this work, we propose a third-order accurate numerical scheme for the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. Spatial and temporal discretization is achieved using Fourier pseudo-spectral approximation and the BDF3 stencil, combined with the Adams-Bashforth extrapolation for the nonlinear convection term, resulting in a semi-implicit, fully discrete formulation. This approach requires solving only a single Poisson-like equation per time step while maintaining the desired temporal accuracy. Classical numerical experiments demonstrate the advantage of our scheme in terms of permissible time step sizes. Moreover, we establish uniform-in-time bounds for the vorticity in both $L^2$ and higher-order $H^m$ norms ($m \\geq 1$), provided the time step is sufficiently small. These bounds, in turn, facilitate the derivation of optimal convergence rates.",

A morphism is called ethic when it satisfies the canonical double-dual compatibility $D^2(f)\u03b7=\u03b7f$. In the derived setting, the functor $\\mathrm{RHom}_E(-,R)$ produces a graded family of Ext-groups that measure all failures of this compatibility. The first layer $\\operatorname{Ext}^1$ identifies primal-dual gaps, while higher $\\operatorname{Ext}^k$ provide a systematic hierarchy of derived obstructions to exactness.\n  This formulation specializes uniformly across several classical domains. In linear and conic optimization, Farkas- and Slater-type exactness criteria correspond to the vanishing of $\\operatorname{Ext}^1$, and integer duality gaps coincide with torsion Ext-classes. In graph theory, Kirchhoff- and Baker-Norine-type dualities arise as instances of ethic exactness. In dynamical systems, the higher derived layers encode nonvanishing persistence phenomena. Additional examples include social-choice configurations, categorical factorization in scattering formalisms, coding-theoretic duality, and Bellman-type recurrences, all appearing as concrete instances of Ext-controlled exactness.\n  All resulting invariants are stable under derived Morita equivalence and depend only on the dualizing pair $(E,R)$. The framework therefore provides a substrate-independent criterion for primal-dual exactness and a uniform homological description of its obstructions.",

Here, we replace the deterministic rate function from the Brownian setting by a random rate process, given by a certain measure-changed $(\u03b1-1)$-stable subordinator. Rather than attaching uniformly, the line-segments now connect to locations chosen with probability proportional to the sizes of the jumps of the rate process.\n  We also give a new proof of an invariance principle originally due to Duquesne, which states that the family tree of a Bienaym\u00e9 branching process with critical offspring distribution in the domain of attraction of an $\u03b1$-stable law (for $\u03b1\\in (1,2))$, conditioned to have $n$ vertices, converges on rescaling distances appropriately to the $\u03b1$-stable tree.

Despite a constant density, the model allows for non-isochoric deformation and the propagation of pressure waves. An additive decomposition of the strain rate into elastic and inelastic parts leads to an evolution equation for the small elastic strain, which is coupled with an adapted momentum equation. As plasticity is modeled through a non-smooth dissipation potential, we introduce a weak formulation in terms of a variational inequality. Since the well-posedness in such a weak setting is out of reach, we study two possible modifications: the regularization in terms of stress diffusion, and the relaxation of the solvability concept by transition to energy-variational solutions. In both cases, solutions are constructed by the same time-discrete scheme, consisting of solving a saddle-point problem in each time step.",

A separation principle is established, showing that the estimate and control procedures can be separated and implemented independently. It extends the classical separation principle to conditional mean-field system. Utilizing two sets of Riccati equations and a set of first-order ordinary differential equations, we derive the feedback representation of the optimal control. To illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results, two applications with numerical simulations are provided, including a one-dimensional LQ example and a coupled electrical machines control problem.",

We conjecture that any two nowhere-zero 5-flows in any 2-edge-connected graph are connected in this way. This can be seen as a reconfiguration variant of Tutte's 5-flow conjecture.\n  We study this problem in the setting of integer flows and group flows, and show that the structure of groups affects the answer, contrary to the existence of nowhere-zero flows. We also highlight a duality with recoloring in planar graphs and deduce that any two nowhere-zero 7-flows in a planar graph are connected, among other results.

In such models, the elastic stress appearing in the macroscopic continuum equation is derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, which makes direct numerical simulations computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce a formal asymptotic scheme that expands the density function around an equilibrium distribution, thereby reducing the high computational cost associated with the fully coupled microscopic processes while still maintaining the dynamic microscopic feedback in explicit expressions. The proposed asymptotic expansion is based on a detailed physical scaling law which characterizes the multiscale balance at the fast relaxation limit of the microscopic state. An asymptotic closure model for the macroscopic fluid equation is then derived according to the explicit asymptotic density expansion. Furthermore, the resulting closure model preserves the energy-dissipation law inherited from the original fully coupled multiscale system. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the asymptotic density formula and the corresponding flow velocity equations in several micro-macro models. This new asymptotic strategy offers a promising approach for efficient computations of a wide range of multiscale complex fluids.",

We show that this norm-constrained formulation has deep consequences for the universality of the so-called \\emph{Berry's cancellation phenomenon}, as well as for novel high-frequency asymptotic variance estimates. These effects manifest themselves in both local geometric functionals, such as the Lipschitz--Killing curvatures, and global ones, such as the number of connected components above a fixed threshold.

    "abstract": "This study compares two statistical approaches to image reconstruction in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We evaluated the widely used Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm and the newer Maximum a Posteriori approach with Entropy prior (MAP-Ent) approach in the context of quantifying radiopharmaceutical uptake in pathological lesions. Numerical experiments were performed using a digital twin of the standardized NEMA IEC phantom, which contains six spheres of varying diameters to simulate lesions. Quantitative accuracy was assessed using the maximum recovery coefficient (RCmax), defined as the ratio of the reconstructed maximum activity to the true value. The study shows that OSEM exhibits unstable convergence during iterations, leading to noise and edge artifacts in lesion images. Post-filtering stabilizes the reconstruction and ensures convergence, producing RCmax-size curves that could be used as correction factors in clinical evaluations. However, this approach significantly underestimates uptake in small lesions and may even lead to the complete loss of small lesions on reconstructed images. In contrast, MAP-Ent demonstrates fundamentally different behavior: it achieves stable convergence and preserves quantitative accuracy without post-filtering, while maintaining the contrast of even the smallest lesions. However, the iteration number at which accurate reconstruction is achieved depends strongly on the choice of a single global regularization parameter, which limits optimal performance across lesions of different sizes. These results demonstrate the need for locally adaptive regularization in MAP-Ent to improve quantitative accuracy in lesion reconstruction.",

We strengthen our formulation with variable fixing techniques that prove highly effective while preserving the polyhedral structure. We perform extensive computations evaluating the performance of different families of methods including a mixed-integer convex formulation, mixed-integer linear optimization, local search and spectral heuristics over a collection of challenging GI instances. We find that a high level of symmetry is beneficial for optimization-based methods. On the other hand, presolving techniques that detect local substructures to fix variables are crucial for asymmetric instances. The proposed method outperforms the second best approach, the integer feasibility approach, on 6 of the 12 graphs families and is on par with it on symmetric families.",

This problem arises across many applications, such as astrophysics (e.g., detecting astrophysical events such as gravitational waves, with two or more detectors) and neuroscience (e.g., detecting synchronous firing patterns between two or more neurons). In this work, we consider methods based on time-shifting, where the timeline of one data stream is randomly shifted relative to another, to mimic the types of coincidences that could occur by random chance. Our theoretical results establish rigorous finite-sample guarantees controlling the probability of false positives, under weak assumptions that allow for dependence within the time series data, providing reassurance that time-shifting methods are a reliable tool for inference in this setting. Empirical results with simulated and real data validate the strong performance of time-shifting methods in dependent-data settings.",

This conjecture is a tremendous strengthening of the Four-Colour Theorem and is regarded as one of the most important open problems in graph theory. The case of Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs with $\u03b1(G) = 2$ has garnered much attention. Seymour writes: ``My own belief is, if Hadwiger's Conjecture is true for graphs with stability number two then it is probably true in general, so it would be very nice to decide this case.''\n  This paper presents several tools useful for proving that a graph $G$ with $\u03b1(G) = 2$ satisfies Hadwiger's Conjecture. In doing so, we survey and generalise several classical results on the $\u03b1(G) = 2$ case of Hadwiger's Conjecture. Further, we apply these tools to prove variants of Hadwiger's Conjecture for several noteworthy classes of graphs with $\u03b1(G) = 2$. In particular, we prove Hadwiger's Conjecture for inflations of the complements of the following graphs: graphs with girth at least $5$, triangle-free Kneser graphs, and the Clebsch, Mesner, and Gewirtz graphs. This paper also highlights classes of graphs with $\u03b1(G) = 2$ where it is unknown if Hadwiger's Conjecture holds.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a computational framework for studying the hyperbolic geometry of 2-bridge link complements and Kleinian groups generated by two parabolic elements. The framework is built on Sakuma-Weeks triangulations and introduces a family of Farey recursive polynomials.\n  For a rational number which determines a hyperbolic 2-bridge link, this paper provides a simple recursive algorithm to determine a Farey recursive polynomial which has a root which determines the geometry of the link complement. This root is the shape parameter for a pair of tetrahedra in the Sakuma-Weeks triangulation. Using the same polynomials, the paper defines rational functions, one function for each edge in the Farey graph. Evaluating these rational functions at the root yields the complete collection of shape parameters for the triangulation.\n  The Riley slice and its exterior lie in the complex plane and are traditionally viewed as parameter spaces for two-parabolic generated subgroups of PSL(2,C). This paper's triangulation-based approach provides a more geometric perspective to these parameter spaces. The Farey recursive methods apply throughout the Riley slice and its exterior, enabling computations for quotient orbifolds of Kleinian groups generated by parabolic pairs, incomplete hyperbolic spaces with non-discrete parameter groups, and others. Explicit calculations include the cusp groups in the boundary of the Riley slice and singly augmented 2-bridge link complements.\n  Applications include: explicit computation of fundamental domains and holonomies for 2-bridge link complements; a precise correspondence between group elements and crossing circles in tangle diagrams; determination of cusp fields for 2-bridge links; geometric analysis of algebraic and geometric limits arising from Dehn surgery on singly augmented 2-bridge links; and explicit triangulations of Heckoid orbifolds.",

In contrast to most existing approaches which generally lead to an infinite-dimensional representation, the proposed EBIF approach yields an iterative procedure for constructing a finite set of smooth coordinate functions that define an embedding, enabling an exact bilinear representation of the original nonlinear dynamics. Leveraging tools from algebra and differential geometry, we establish both necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonlinear system to be exactly bilinearizable. We further illustrate how the EBIF-induced bilinear systems facilitate reachability analysis and control design.

This paper studies quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings $GR(p^{s}, p^{sm})$ and proposes various direct construction methods for such matrices. The construction is based on skew polynomial rings $GR(p^{s}, p^{sm})[X;\u03c3]$, whose rich factorization properties and enlarged class of polynomials are used to define companion matrices generating quasi-recursive MDS matrices. First, two criteria are established for characterizing polynomials that yield recursive MDS matrices, generalizing existing results, and then an additional criterion is derived in terms of the right roots of the associated Wedderburn polynomial. Using these criteria, methods are developed to construct skew polynomials that give rise to quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings. This framework extends known constructions to the non-commutative setting and significantly enlarges the family of available matrices, with potential applications to efficient diffusion layers in cryptographic primitives. The results are particularly relevant for practical implementations when $s = 1$ and $p = 2$, i.e., over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, which is of central interest in real-world cryptographic applications.",

To address this issue, this paper proposes a coverage control formulation based on beacon-free rotary pointer partition mechanism. A partition dynamics is designed to enable the asymptotical consensus of multi-agent reference points, as well as the workload-balanced subdivision of coverage region. On this basis, a distributed coverage control algorithm is developed to drive each agent toward the optimal deployment of their respective subregions, thereby minimizing the coverage cost. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed coverage control method can significantly improve overall coverage efficiency with workload balance among agents, and exhibit strong adaptability and robustness in uncertain environments.",

    "abstract": "Probing is an important presolving technique in mixed-integer programming solvers. It selects binary variables, tentatively fixes them to 0 and 1, and performs propagation to deduce additional variable fixings, bound tightenings, substitutions, and implications. In this work, we propose clique probing instead of probing on individual variables, we select cliques, a set of binary variables of which at most one can be set to one, and systematically probe on all variables of a clique. Experiments with our implementation in the open-source presolve library PaPILO demonstrate that exploiting clique information in this form significantly increases the number of reductions. When integrated into the MIP solver SCIP, we observe a 3% performance improvement on MIPLIB instances containing cliques.",

The Biot system couples elastic deformation of a porous solid with viscous fluid flow and commonly arises on domains with complex geometries that make high-quality volumetric meshing challenging. To address this issue, we employ the cut finite element framework, where the domain boundary is represented independently of the background mesh, which significantly simplifies the meshing process. Our approach builds upon a parameter robust total pressure formulation of the Biot system, which we combine with the cut finite element method to develop a geometrically robust solution scheme, while preserving the parameter robustness. A key ingredient in the theoretical analysis is a modified inf-sup condition which also holds for mixed boundary conditions, leading to stability and optimal error estimates for the proposed formulation. Finally, we provide numerical evidence demonstrating the theoretical properties of the method and showcasing its capabilities by solving the Biot system on a realistic brain geometry.",

Unsurprisingly, immediate extraction of all available resources is an equilibrium. A main result is that we characterize and prove the existence of non-trivial equilibria that do not result in immediate absorption, but instead are attained with both players extracting resources according to a state-dependent rate of threshold type, corresponding to the presence of control only when the state process is in an interval $(b,\\infty)$. The underlying assumption is, roughly, that the drift coefficient of the uncontrolled state process grows sufficiently fast in relation to the discount rate, implying that the value for the corresponding one-player problem is infinite. We also study a generalization of the game that allows a state-dependent profit rate integrated against the control processes. In this game we again characterize and prove the existence of non-trivial equilibria of threshold type. In particular, a main novelty is that we find equilibria where the state process is controlled with its own local time such that we have reflection points with associated initial jumps, as well as other points in the state space where the control processes increase in a singular manner (skew points).",

The focus is on a code whose Hermitian hull dimension and dual distance can be systematically determined. Such a code can serve as an ingredient in designing the parameters of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs).\n  We use tools from algebraic function fields of one variable to efficiently determine a good lower bound on the Hermitian hull dimensions of generalized rational algebraic geometry (AG) codes. We identify families of AG codes whose hull dimensions can be well estimated by a lower bound. Given such a code, the idea is to select a set of evaluation points for which the residues of the Weil differential associated with the Hermitian dual code has an easily verifiable property.\n  The approach allows us to construct codes with designed Hermitian hull dimensions based on known results on Reed-Solomon codes and their generalization. Using the Hermitian method on these maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with designed hull dimensions yields two families of MDS EAQECCs. We confirm that the excellent parameters of the quantum codes from these families are new.",

We introduce an alternating low-rank then diagonal (Alt) algorithm that provably reduces approximation error and significantly outperforms gradient descent while remaining cheaper than majorization-minimization methods~\\cite{sun2016majorization}. To scale to large matrices, we develop a randomized LRPD variant that combines fixed-rank Nystrom sketching~\\cite{tropp2017fixed} for the low-rank component with Diag++ stochastic diagonal estimation~\\cite{baston2022stochastic}. This hybrid algorithm achieves machine precision decomposition error using a number of matrix-vector products far smaller than the ambient dimension, and comes with rigorous non-asymptotic error bounds. On synthetic data, it exactly recovers LRPD structured matrices with high efficiency, and on real-world S&P 500 stock return covariances, where the spectrum decays slowly and strong sector structure exists, it achieves substantially lower error than pure low-rank approximations.",

The rates are controlled by the spectrum of the covariance operator of the measure that defines the error metric. Our setup is very general and allows for measures with unbounded support. A key implication is a curse of sample complexity which shows that the minimax risk for generic Lipschitz operators cannot decay at any algebraic rate in the sample size.

We address this question through a parameterized analysis.\n  For constants $0 \\le c_1 \\le c_2 \\le 1$, we define $\\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ as the restriction of BDR to degree sequences of length $n$ whose degrees lie in the interval $[c_1 n, c_2 n]$.

Motivated by the symmetry-breaking phenomena observed in semilinear second-order problems -- such as those governed by the H\u00e9non equation -- we consider weighted functionals of the form \\begin{equation*} F_m(u) = \\int_B |x|^\u03b1\\left( e^{\u03c3|u|^2} - \\sum_{k=0}^m \\frac{\u03c3^k}{k!} |u|^{2k} \\right) dx, \\end{equation*} defined on the unit ball \\( B \\subset \\mathbb{R}^4 \\), where $m\\in \\mathbb N_0$ \\( \u03b1> 0 \\), \\( \u03c3>0\\) are suitable parameters. We first establish an Adams-type inequality with weight, characterizing the sharp threshold for the boundedness of \\( F \\) on the unit sphere of the biharmonic Sobolev space. Then, we prove that for large values of the weight exponent \\( \u03b1\\), radial symmetry of maximizers is broken. %, i.e., the supremum of the functional is strictly larger when taken over the full space compared to the radial subspace. These results extend classical findings in the second-order setting (e.g., Trudinger--Moser-type functionals and the weighted H\u00e9non equation)\n  to the biharmonic context and offer new insights into the interplay between weights, nonlinearity, and symmetry in higher-order PDEs.",

Unsourced random access (URA) has emerged as a promising approach, delivering high spectral and energy efficiency. Among URA code structures, the random spreading (RS) category is a key enabler, providing strong anti-interference capabilities through spectrum spreading gain. Notably, RS-URA approaches theoretical performance limits over the Gaussian multiple access channel in scenarios with few active users. In this paper, we propose an iterative Gaussian approximation decoder designed universally for RS-URA categories. The proposed receiver iterates extrinsic and intrinsic soft information to enhance decoding performance, requiring only a few iterations to converge.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the time-optimal control problem for the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch (LLB) equation, a macroscopic model that characterizes magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials across a wide temperature range, including near and above the Curie temperature. We analyze the LLB system on bounded domains in one, two, and three dimensions, establishing the existence of optimal controls that drive the magnetization to a desired target state within a minimal time frame. Utilizing a Lagrange multiplier approach and an adjoint-based framework, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions. Furthermore, we establish second-order sufficient conditions for local optimality, addressing the mathematical challenges posed by the system's inherent nonlinearities and the nonlinear appearance of the control in the effective magnetic field. These results provide a rigorous theoretical basis for the rapid manipulation of magnetic states, offering insights into the fundamental limits of control for nonlinear diffusion-relaxation processes in magnetism. Such findings are essential for advancing high-speed magnetic memory technologies and optimizing thermal magnetic switching in next-generation storage technologies.",

    "abstract": "In classical percolation theory, the van den Berg-Kesten (BK) inequality is a fundamental tool that shows that disjoint events induce negative conditionings on each other. The inequality also holds in the context of last passage percolation (LPP), which is the zero temperature limit of polymer models and an important subclass in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Recently, an analog of the BK inequality was discovered in the context of zero temperature line ensembles and the scaling limit of LPP, where it was used to study upper tail probabilities of the weight and the scaling limit of geodesics under such upper tail conditionings. However, while it has become apparent that such an inequality in the positive temperature setting would have a number of applications, it seems likely that a direct generalization of the zero temperature inequality would not hold. In this work we prove a version of the BK inequality for the KPZ line ensemble and the continuum directed random polymer. We do so by working with the log gamma polymer, making use of its integrability and the geometric RSK correspondence. Our inequality serves as a key input in analyzing the KPZ line ensemble and proving sharp upper tail estimates of the KPZ equation in arXiv:2208.08922, and proving convergence of the continuum directed random polymer to Brownian bridge under the upper tail event in arXiv:2311.12009. The crucial role of integrability in the validity of such an inequality is highlighted via a counter-example for a non-integrable model.",

In this limit antimatter and spin remain as intrinsically relativistic effects on a classical level. Our global-in-time results use Wigner transforms and a Lagrange multiplier viewpoint of the matrix-valued Wigner equation. In particular, we pass to the limit in the ''full\" Wigner matrix equation without projecting on the eigenspaces of the matrix-valued symbol of the Dirac operator. In the limit, the Lagrange multiplier maintains the constraint that the Wigner measure and the symbol of the Dirac operator commute and vanishes when projected on the electron or positron eigenspace. This is a different approach to the problem as discussed in [P. G\u00e9rard, P. Markowich, N.J. Mauser, F. Poupaud: Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 50(4):323--379, 1997], where the limit is taken in the projected Wigner equation. By explicit calculation of the remainder term in the expansion of the Moyal product we are able to generalize to time-dependent potentials with much less regularity. We use uniform $L^2$ bounds for the Wigner transform, which are only possible for a special class of mixed states as initial data.",

Depending on the relation between thickness and the size of the cylinders, it was introduced in (Fabricius et al., Transp. Porous Media, 115, 473-493, 2016), (Anguiano and Su\u00e1rez-Grau, Z. Angew.

In each regime, the asymptotic behavior of the fluid is governed by a lower-dimensional Darcy's law.\n  In previous studies, the Reynolds number is considered to be of order one and so, the question that arises is for what range of values of the Reynolds number the lower-dimensional Darcy laws are still valid in each regime, which represents the main the goal of this paper. In this sense, considering a fluid governed by the Navier-Stokes system and assuming the Reynolds number written in terms of the thickness $\u03b5$, we prove that, for each regime, there exists a critical Reynolds number $Re_c$ such that for every Reynolds number $Re$ with order smaller or equal than $Re_c$, the lower-dimensional Darcy law is still valid. On the contrary, for Reynolds numbers $Re$ greater than $Re_c$, the inertial term of the Navier-Stokes system has to be taken into account in the asymptotic behavior and so, the Darcy law is not valid.",

The temperature positivity is also shown. Next, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. We show that the divergence-free part of the displacement oscillates.

    "abstract": "Given a semisimple compact Lie group $G$ and a nonzero dominant integral weight $\u03bb$, the highest weight $G_q$-modules $V_{n\u03bb}$ form a subproduct system of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Using a conjectural asymptotic behavior of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients we identify the corresponding Cuntz-Pimsner algebras with algebras of quantized functions on homogeneous spaces of $G$. We also show that the gauge-invariant part of the Toeplitz algebra provides a model for convergence of full matrix algebras to quantum flag manifolds, complementing and generalizing results of Landsman and Rieffel for $q=1$ and results of Vaes-Vergnioux in the rank one case for $q\\ne1$.\n  We verify our conjecture on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $G=SU(n)$ and all weights that are either regular or multiples of the fundamental weight $\u03c9_1$. For $\u03bb=\u03c9_1$, we also provide a detailed description of the Toeplitz and Cuntz-Pimsner algebras, generalizing results of Arveson on symmetric subproduct systems.",

    "abstract": "We study the existence problem for achronal hypersurfaces $M \\hookrightarrow \\overline{M}$ in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, whose mean curvature is a prescribed -- possibly singular -- source, and whose boundary is a given smooth spacelike submanifold. Since $M$ is allowed to go null somewhere, the mean curvature prescription is to be understood in the distributional sense. We prove a general existence and regularity theorem for surfaces in ambient dimension $3$. Although most of our estimates hold in any dimension, recent counterexamples show that some of our conclusions fail in ambient dimension at least $5$. The case of $4$D-spacetimes is an open problem. Our theorems have application to Born-Infeld electrostatics in general static spacetimes.",

    "title": "Local h-, p-, and k-Refinement Strategies for the Isogeometric Shifted Boundary Method Using THB-Splines",
    "abstract": "The concept of trimming, embedding, or immersing geometries into a computational background mesh has gained considerable attention in recent years, particularly in isogeometric analysis (IGA). In this approach, the physical domain is represented independently from the computational mesh, allowing the latter to be generated more easily compared with body-fitted meshes. While this facilitates the treatment of complex geometries, it also introduces challenges, such as ill-conditioning of the stiffness matrix caused by small cut elements and difficulties in accurately enforcing boundary conditions. A recently proposed technique to address these issues is the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM), which represents the computational domain solely through uncut elements and enforces boundary conditions via a Taylor expansion from a surrogate boundary to the true boundary. Previous studies have shown that, for Neumann boundary conditions, the flux evaluation requires additional derivatives in the Taylor expansion, effectively reducing the order of convergence by one. In this work, we investigate for the first time the performance of SBM combined with Truncated Hierarchical B-splines (THB-splines) under various local refinement strategies. In particular, we propose local p- and k-refinement schemes for THB-splines and compare them with local h-refinement and the unmodified SBM. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced shift operator that incorporates mixed partial derivatives, in contrast to the standard operator. The study assesses accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency for benchmark problems on trimmed domains. The results highlight how different refinement strategies affect convergence behavior in trimmed IGA formulations using SBM and demonstrate that targeted degree elevation can mitigate the Neumann boundary limitations of the standard method.",

    "abstract": "This article records multiple results coming from interplay between de-completed topological periodic cyclic homology, Segal conjecture, and F-smoothness.\n  We establish completeness of motivic filtration on de-completed topological periodic cyclic homology of commutative rings with weakly finitely generated absolute cotangent complex. When the ring in question is in addition F-smooth, we show that Segal conjecture holds for its topological Hochschild homology. We also identify our de-completed topological periodic cyclic homology with Manam's Frobenius untwisted topological periodic cyclic homology for quasiregular semiperfectoid rings.\n  We find a crystalline degeneration of Segal conjecture which corresponds to such a statement for F-smoothness. On the other hand, inspired by constructions for topological Hochschild homology, the theory of cyclotomic synthetic spectra allows us to produce a relative conjugate filtration on Hodge--Tate cohomology and its variants, and in the same time, a relative conjugate filtration on topological Hochschild homology and its variants. As a consequence, we deduce transitivity of weak and strong F-smoothness.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a persistent commutative algebra for studying the algebraic and combinatorial evolution of edge ideals of graphs and hypergraphs under filtration. Building on the Persistent Stanley--Reisner Theory (PSRT), we develop the notion of persistent edge ideals and analyze their graded Betti numbers across the filtration of graphs or hypergraphs. To enable this analysis, we establish a persistent extension of Hochster's formula, providing a functorial correspondence between algebraic and topological persistence. We further examine the behavior of Betti splittings in the persistent setting, proving a general inequality that extends the classical splitting result to the filtration of monomial ideals. Motivated by graph-theoretic interpretations, we introduce persistent minimal vertex covers, which encode the temporal structure of combinatorial dependencies within evolving graphs or hypergraphs. Applications to alignment-free genomic classification and molecular isomer discrimination demonstrate the interpretability and representatbility of persistent edge ideals as algebraic invariants, bridging combinatorial commutative algebra and data science.",
