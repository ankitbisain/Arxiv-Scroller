    "abstract": "We consider max-min and min-max problems with objective functions that are possibly non-smooth, submodular with respect to the minimiser and concave with respect to the maximiser. We investigate the performance of a zeroth-order method applied to this problem. The method is based on the subgradient of the Lov\u00e1sz extension of the objective function with respect to the minimiser and based on Gaussian smoothing to estimate the smoothed function gradient with respect to the maximiser. In expectation sense, we prove the convergence of the algorithm to an $\u03b5$-saddle point in the offline case. Moreover, we show that, in the expectation sense, in the online setting, the algorithm achieves $O(\\sqrt{N\\bar{P}_N})$ online duality gap, where $N$ is the number of iterations and $\\bar{P}_N$ is the path length of the sequence of optimal decisions. The complexity analysis and hyperparameter selection are presented for all the cases. The theoretical results are illustrated via numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "Using Stein's method techniques introduced by Chatterjee (2008) and further extended by Kasprzak and Peccati (2022) and by Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey and Peccati (2017), we derive novel quantitative bounds on the convergence in distribution of feed-forward fully connected neural networks (with Lipschitz activation functions) towards Gaussian processes, as the hidden layer width $n$ tends to infinity. We consider networks initialized with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) weights possessing sufficiently many finite moments, and i.i.d. Gaussian biases independent of the weights. Specifically, when the network is evaluated at a single input, we obtain convergence rates of order $O(n^{-1/2})$ in both total variation and Wasserstein distances. When evaluated at a general finite collection of inputs, we establish bounds of the same order in terms of the convex distance. All bounds are given in explicit and computable form. As a consequence of our estimates, we also deduce a novel convergence result in the regime where the depth of the neural network increases simultaneously with the width $n$, up to order $O\\big((\\log_2 n)^{1/3}\\big)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CLT in the infinite width/depth limit holding for general (nonlinear) Lipschitz activation functions and non-Gaussian weight distributions. Our analysis yields several results of independent interest, including: (i) an explicit lower bound on the determinant of the limiting covariance matrix and (ii) new advances in Stein's method, both for the one-dimensional Stein's equation associated with the square of a Lipschitz function and for the multivariate Stein's equation associated with the tensor product of a Lipschitz function with itself.",

In particular, for the smoothest spline (B-spline) solution, the abundance of superconvergence points allows us to construct asymptotic expansion of the error within the element that fully characterize all superconvergence points, for both function values and derivatives. The theoretical framework is then extended to higher-dimensional settings on simplicial and tensor-product meshes, and the essential conclusions are preserved, with one-dimensional derivatives generalized to mixed derivatives. Numerical experiments demonstrate that superconvergence persists even in extremely localized symmetric regions, revealing that superconvergence points are both readily attainable and follow systematic distribution patterns.",

For this class, we show that bit-node and check-node combining can be tracked efficiently via closed-form recursions on the Gram-matrix eigenvalues, independent of the particular physical realization of the output states. These recursions yield explicit BPQM unitaries and analytic bounds on the fidelities of the combined channels in terms of the input-channel fidelities.

    "abstract": "We investigate the superintegrability of rigid body rotors coupled to planar systems. In particular, we study the isotropic harmonic oscillator in two dimensions, with its (central) force acting on the rotor's center of mass constrained to move in the plane. By including an internal rotational degree of freedom described by a rigid rotor, the resulting planar system possesses three degrees of freedom: two translational and one rotational. When the orbital motion and the internal rotation are tuned to resonance, additional integrals of motion arise, extending the hidden symmetry algebras of the underlying models. For the oscillator, the well-known $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ symmetry algebra can be enlarged by the presence of the rotor, with the conserved momentum $p_\u03b8$ reasonably playing the role of a deformation parameter. These algebraic structures remain to be properly understood, and we hope that this short letter will serve as an invitation to further investigate these interesting models. To close the work, we also examine the oscillator in a vertical plane, in the presence of a rotor, under the effect of a uniform gravitational field, showing that the algebraic structure persists as a translated version of the isotropic case, as expected. In all these settings, the extended dynamics admits five functionally independent integrals, thereby confirming maximal superintegrability. Our simple yet nontrivial results suggest that rigid-body rotors provide a natural mechanism for generating new families of (resonant) superintegrable systems, along with their associated symmetry algebras, an outcome that aligns with the main objective of this work.",

We assume throughout that the set of all of these random variables follows a joint Gaussian distribution, and that we have the covariance matrix available. Finally, we measure information using Shannon's differential entropy.\n  The main approach for exact solution of moderate-sized instances of MERSP has been branch-and-bound, and so previous work concentrated on upper bounds. Prior to our work, there were two upper-bounding methods for MERSP: the so-called NLP bound and the spectral bound, both introduced 25 years ago. We are able now to establish domination results between these two upper bounds. We propose an ``augmented NLP bound'' based on a subtle convex relaxation. We provide theoretical guarantees, giving sufficient conditions under which the augmented NLP bound strictly dominates the ordinary NLP bound. In addition, the augmented NLP formulation allows us to derive upper bounds for rank-deficient covariance matrices when they satisfy a technical condition. This is in contrast to the earlier work on the ordinary NLP bound that worked with only positive definite covariance matrices. Finally, we introduce a novel and very effective diagonal-scaling technique for MERSP, employing a positive vector of parameters. Numerical experiments on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in advancing the state of the art for calculating upper bounds on MERSP.",

In the second part, combining the circle method with sieve methods, we study the second moment of the corresponding unweighted counting function. This allows us to get a nontrivial lower bound for the cardinality of the set $$\\{ n \\leq g^k : n \\text{ omits the digit } b \\text{ in its base } g \\text{ expansion and } n = p^2 + q^2 \\text{ for some primes } p,q \\}. $$",

    "abstract": "We introduce a validity-filtered, certificate-based view of reactions grounded in Algorithmic Information Theory. A fixed, total, input-blind executor maps a self-delimiting advice string to a candidate response, accepted only if a decidable or semi-decidable validity predicate V(x, r) holds. The minimum feasible realizer complexity M(x) = min_{r: V(x,r)=1} K(r), with K denoting prefix Kolmogorov complexity, measures the minimal information required for a valid outcome. We define the Normalized Advice Quantile (NAQ) as the percentile of M(x) across a reference pool, yielding a scale-free hardness index on [0, 1] robust to the choice of universal machine and comparable across task families. An Exact Realizer Identity shows that the minimal advice for any input-blind executor equals M(x) up to O(1), while a description plus selection upper bound refines it via computable feature maps, separating description cost K(y) from selection cost log i_y(x). In finite-ambiguity regimes M(x) approximately equals min_y K(y); in generic-fiber regimes the bound is tight. NAQ is quasi-invariant under bounded enumeration changes. An operational converse links NAQ to rate-distortion: communicating advice with error epsilon requires average length near the entropy of target features. Extensions include a resource-bounded variant NAQ_t incorporating time-penalized complexity (Levin's Kt) and an NP-style setting showing linear worst-case advice n - O(1). Finally, a DKW bound guarantees convergence of empirical NAQ estimates, enabling data-driven calibration via compressor-based proxies.",

To obtain a strategy for edge weights refinement, we derive a design function inspired by the cost-to-go function in a new convergence analysis for Di-DGD. This results in a data-dependent dynamical design for the edge weights. A fully decentralized version of D3GD is developed such that each agent refines its communication strategy using only neighbor's information. Numerical experiments show that D3GD accelerates convergence towards stationary solution by 30-40\\% over Di-DGD, and learns edge weights that adapt to data similarity.",

Both approaches exploit the semi-group property of the underlying diffeomorphic flow, enabling the reconstruction of solutions through flow maps that trace characteristics back to their initial positions. NuFI builds this flow map iteratively, preserving symplectic structure and conserving invariants, but its computational cost scales quadratically with time. Its advantage lies in a compact, low-dimensional representation depending only on the electric field. In contrast, CMM achieves low computational costs when remapping by composing the global flow map from explicitly stored submaps. The proposed hybrid method merges these strengths: NuFi is employed for accurate and conservative local time stepping, while CMM efficiently propagates the solution through submap composition. This approach reduces storage requirements, maintains accuracy, and improves structural properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme and highlight the trade-offs between memory usage and computational cost. We benchmark against a semi-Lagrangian predictor-corrector scheme used in modern gyrokinetic codes, evaluating accuracy and conservation properties.",

Next, sufficient conditions are proposed to guarantee the global stability invariance of ordinary differential systems under the influence of diffusions. New theorems show that the diffusion is a double-edged sword in judging the stability of diffusion systems. Besides, an example is constructed to illuminate that any non-zero constant equilibrium point must be not in the phase plane of dynamic system under Dirichlet zero boundary value, or it must lead to a contradiction. Next, under Lipschitz assumptions on active function, another example is designed to prove that the small diffusion effect will cause the essential change of the phase plane structure of the dynamic behavior of the delayed neural networks via a Saddle point theorem. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the feasibility of the proposed methods. It is worth mentioning that some interesting mathematical problems are originally put forward in the last chapter.",

    "abstract": "Stratified fluids composed of a sequence of alternate layers show interesting macroscopic properties, which may be quite different from those of the individual constituent fluids. On a macroscopic scale, such systems can be considered a sort of fluid metamaterial. In many cases each fluid layer can be described by Euler equations following the stiffened gas equation of state. The computation of detailed numerical solutions of such stratified material poses several challenges, first and foremost the issue of artificial smearing of material parameters across interface boundaries. Lagrangian schemes completely eliminate this issue, but at the cost of rather stringent time step restrictions. In this work we introduce an implicit numerical method for the multimaterial Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates. The implicit discretization is aimed at bypassing the prohibitive time step restrictions present in flows with stratified media, where one of the materials is particularly dense, or rigid (or both). This is the case for flows of water-air mixtures, air-granular media, or similar high density ratio systems. We will present the novel discretisation approach, which makes extensive use of the remarkable structure of the governing equations in Lagrangian coordinates to find the solution by means of a single implicit discrete wave equation for the pressure field, yielding a symmetric positive definite structure and thus a particularly efficient algorithm. Additionally, we will introduce simple filtering strategies for counteracting the emergence of pressure or density oscillations typically encountered in multimaterial flows, and will present results concerning the robustness, accuracy, and performance of the proposed method, including applications to stratified media with high density and stiffness ratios.",

At the same time, we embed entropy-stable design principles by jointly learning a convex entropy function and its associated flux potential, ensuring entropy dissipation and the selection of physically admissible weak solutions. A corresponding entropy-stable numerical flux scheme provides compatibility with standard discretizations, allowing seamless integration into classical solvers. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems, including Burgers, shallow water, Euler, and KPP equations, demonstrate that SymCLaw generalizes to unseen initial conditions, maintains stability under noisy training data, and achieves accurate long-time predictions, highlighting its potential as a principled foundation for data-driven modeling of hyperbolic conservation laws.",

The key ingredients of the proof include PDE uniqueness for continuous densities and a uniform-in-$\u03b5$ estimate on modulus of continuity of prelimit densities.

Covariate shift occurs when the input distributions of the training and test data differ, introducing significant challenges for reliable learning. By restricting the hypothesis space, we develop a practical operator learning algorithm capable of handling functional outputs. We establish optimal convergence rates for the proposed framework under a general source condition, providing a theoretical foundation for regularized learning in this setting. We also propose an aggregation-based approach that forms a linear combination of estimators corresponding to different regularization parameters and different kernels. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate tuning parameters, which is crucial for constructing a good estimator, and we provide a theoretical justification for its effectiveness. Furthermore, we illustrate the proposed method on a real-world face image dataset, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in mitigating distributional discrepancies under covariate shift.",

    "abstract": "The spectral analysis of operators in heterogeneous and aging media typically requires a functional framework that extends beyond the standard Hilbertian setting. In this paper, we establish a rigorous distributional theory for a class of non-local operators, termed Weighted Weyl-Sonine operators, by employing a structure-preserving transmutation method. We construct the Weighted Schwartz Space $\\mathcal{S}_{\u03c8,\u03c9}$ and its topological dual, the space of Weighted Tempered Distributions $\\mathcal{S}'_{\u03c8,\u03c9}$, ensuring that the underlying Fr\u00e9chet topology is consistent with the infinitesimal generator of the aging dynamics. This topological foundation allows us to: (i) extend the Weighted Fourier Transform to generalized functions as a unitary isomorphism; (ii) provide an explicit spectral characterization of the weighted Dirac delta $\u03b4_{\u03c8,\u03c9}$ and its scaling laws under geometric dilations; and (iii) introduce a scale of Weighted Sobolev Spaces $H^{s}_{\u03c8,\u03c9}$ defined via spectral multipliers. A central result is the derivation of a sharp embedding theorem, $|u(t)| \\le C \u03c9(t)^{-1} \\|u\\|_{H^s_{\u03c8,\u03c9}}$, which rigorously connects abstract spectral energy to the pointwise decay induced by the weight $\u03c9$.

    "abstract": "There are two objectives to this work: to classify all tame integer tilings and to classify all tame integer hypertilings. Motivation for the first objective comes from Conway and Coxeter's modelling of positive integer friezes using triangulated polygons, which has received significant attention since the discovery of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2002. Assem, Reutenauer, and Smith introduced $\\text{SL}_2$-tilings as generalisations of friezes, and Bessenrodt, Holm, and J\u00f8rgensen classified positive integer $\\text{SL}_2$-tilings using infinite triangulated polygons. Here we consider $N$-tilings, of which $\\text{SL}_2$-tilings are the case $N=1$. We provide a geometric model for all tame integer $N$-tilings using a generalisation of the Farey graph in the hyperbolic plane. Highlights of this model include classifications of all positive integer $N$-tilings and of all quiddity sequences of positive rational friezes using triangulated polygons.\n  The second objective is motivated by Bhargava's celebrated study of binary quadratic forms using integer cubes and by an observation of Demonet et al.\\ that there is essentially only one three-dimensional positive integer tiling with $\\text{SL}_2$ cross sections. We consider a richer class of three-dimensional tilings, which we call hypertilings, using the Cayley hyperdeterminant. We classify all tame integer hypertilings using generalised Farey graphs; remarkably, those with Cayley hyperdeterminant 1 prove to have a simple description in terms of triple Hadamard products of integer pairs.",

Multistatic, in this context, means that the transmitters and receivers need not be co-located. The reflectivity is anisotropic if it depends on direction, and in the multistatic case this means incoming and outgoing direction. Travel-time problems can be formulated as generalized Radon transforms of integrals over isochrones, in the planar case ellipses with transmitter and receivers at foci. In a simplified case where transmitters and receivers are distant from the scene, isochrones can be approximated by straight lines. We relate this to tensor ray transforms, specifically the longitudinal ray transform of Sharafutdinov, and discuss the implication of its known null-space. In the volumetric case isochrones are spheroids and we relate the problem to the normal Radon transform of tensor fields.",

We show that the Agashe--Stein construction always yields minimal visualizations for these orders. We also build upon the Cremona--Mazur construction and show how it can be made totally explicit. While the Cremona--Mazur construction can produce non-minimal objects, an appropriate choice in the construction for order $2$ elements $\u03c3$ yields an explicit genus $2$ curve whose Jacobian is a minimal visualization.

Using the method of Hilbert expansion, we first derive a bi-Maxwellian determined by the Euler-Poisson system of two fluids. To justify the convergence of the solution rigorously as the Knudsen number tends to zero, we sequentially calculate the first $2k-1$ terms of the expansion series $(k \\geq 6)$, and then truncate it, and express the solution as the sum of these first $2k-1$ terms and a remainder term. Within the framework of the $L_{x,v}^2-W_{x,v}^{1,\\infty}$ interplay established by Guo and Jang \\cite{[ininp]Guo2010CMP}, we construct a new weight function to estimate the remainder term in four different cases regarding the potential $\u03b3$. Here, the particle masses $m^A, m^B > 0$ and their charges $e^A, e^B$ can be given arbitrarily. This causes the collision operator to exhibit asymmetric effects ($m^A \\neq m^B$), rendering the system of equations impossible to decouple. So, it adds difficulties to both $L^2$, $L^{\\infty}$ estimates for the remainder. Therefore, we adopt the framework of vector-valued functions and analyze the velocity decay rate of the operator $K_{M,2,w}^{\u03b1,c}$ to eliminate the singularity induced by small parameters in characteristic line iterations. Our results show that the validity time of the solution is $O(\\varepsilon^{-y})$, where $y$ is $-\\frac{2k-3}{2(2k-1)}$ when $-1 \\leq \u03b3\\leq 1$, and it becomes $-\\frac{2k-3}{(1-\u03b3)(2k-1)}$, when $-3 < \u03b3< -1$.

We show convergence, with mild conditions on the joint distribution of offspring frequencies and migrations, of gene genealogies conditional on the pedigree to a time-inhomogeneous coalescent process driven by a Poisson point process $\u03a8$ that records the timing and scale of large migrations and uneven offspring distributions. This quenched scaling limit demonstrates a significant difference in the predictions of the classical annealed theory of structured coalescent processes. In particular, the annealed and quenched scaling limits coincide if and only if these large migrations and uneven offspring distributions are absent. The proof proceeds by the method of moments and utilizes coupling techniques from the theory of random walks in random environments.

    "abstract": "Unpredictable sensor-to-estimator delays fundamentally distort what matters for wireless remote state estimation: not just freshness, but how delay interacts with sensor informativeness and energy efficiency. In this paper, we present a unified, delay-aware framework that models this coupling explicitly and quantifies a delay-dependent information gain, motivating an information-per-joule scheduling objective beyond age of information proxies (AoI). To this end, we first introduce an efficient posterior-fusion update that incorporates delayed measurements without state augmentation, providing a consistent approximation to optimal delayed Kalman updates, and then derive tractable stability conditions ensuring that bounded estimation error is achievable under stochastic, delayed scheduling. This conditions highlight the need for unstable modes to be observable across sensors. Building on this foundation, we cast scheduling as a Markov decision process and develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) scheduler that learns directly from interaction, requires no prior delay model, and explicitly trades off estimation accuracy, freshness, sensor heterogeneity, and transmission energy through normalized rewards. In simulations with heterogeneous sensors, realistic link-energy models, and random delays, the proposed method learns stably and consistently achieves lower estimation error at comparable energy than random scheduling and strong RL baselines (DQN, A2C), while remaining robust to variations in measurement availability and process/measurement noise.",

Specifically, we consider the Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) method for DLRA proposed and analyzed in arXiv:2308.11581v4, which consists of a linear combination of products between deterministic orthonormal modes and stochastic modes, both time-dependent. The first strategy we consider for numerical time-integration is very standard, consisting in a forward discretization in time of both deterministic and stochastic components. Its convergence is proven subject to a time-step restriction dependent on the smallest singular value of the Gram matrix associated to the stochastic modes. Under the same condition on the time-step, this smallest singular value is shown to be always positive, provided that the SDE under study is driven by a non-degenerate noise. The second and the third algorithms, on the other hand, are staggered ones, in which we alternately update the deterministic and the stochastic modes in half steps. These approaches are shown to be more stable than the first one and allow us to obtain convergence results without the aforementioned restriction on the time-step. Computational experiments support theoretical results. In this work we do not consider the discretization in probability, which will be the topic of Part II.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive sampling schemes are well known to create complex dependence that may invalidate conventional inference methods. A recent line of work shows that this need not be the case for UCB-type algorithms in multi-armed bandits. A central emerging theme is a `stability' property with asymptotically deterministic arm-pull counts in these algorithms, making inference as easy as in the i.i.d. setting.\n  In this paper, we study the precise arm-pull dynamics in another canonical class of Thompson-sampling type algorithms. We show that the phenomenology is qualitatively different: the arm-pull count is asymptotically deterministic if and only if the arm is suboptimal or is the unique optimal arm; otherwise it converges in distribution to the unique invariant law of an SDE. This dichotomy uncovers a unifying principle behind many existing (in)stability results: an arm is stable if and only if its interaction with statistical noise is asymptotically negligible.\n  As an application, we show that normalized arm means obey the same dichotomy, with Gaussian limits for stable arms and a semi-universal, non-Gaussian limit for unstable arms. This not only enables the construction of confidence intervals for the unknown mean rewards despite non-normality, but also reveals the potential of developing tractable inference procedures beyond the stable regime.\n  The proofs rely on two new approaches. For suboptimal arms, we develop an `inverse process' approach that characterizes the inverse of the arm-pull count process via a Stieltjes integral. For optimal arms, we adopt a reparametrization of the arm-pull and noise processes that reduces the singularity in the natural SDE to proving the uniqueness of the invariant law of another SDE. We prove the latter by a set of analytic tools, including the parabolic H\u00f6rmander condition and the Stroock-Varadhan support theorem.",

We also study quaternionic modular forms in the more general setting of a group $G_J$ associated to a cubic norm structure $J$.

Specifically, our opinion model involves a large crowd of $N$ indistinguishable agents, each characterized by an opinion value ranging within the interval $[-1,1]$. At each update time, two agents are picked uniformly at random and the opinion of one agent will either shift by a proportion $\u03bc_+ \\in (0,1]$ towards $+1$, or by a proportion $\u03bc_- \\in (0,1]$ towards $-1$, with probabilities depending on the other agent's opinion. We rigorously derive the mean-field limit PDE that governs the large-population limit of the agent-based model and present several quantitative results demonstrating convergence to the unique equilibrium distribution. Remarkably, for a suitable choice of model parameters, the long-term equilibrium opinion profile displays a striking self-similar structure that generalizes the celebrated Bernoulli convolution, a topic extensively studied in the context of fractal geometry [23,44]. These findings also enhance our understanding of the opinion fragmentation phenomenon and may provide valuable insights for the development of more sophisticated models in future research.",

    "abstract": "We consider a non-interacting electron gas confined to a two-dimensional crystal by the action of a perpendicular magnetic field; in the one-particle approximation, the dynamics of the system is modelled by a spectrally gapped Bloch-Landau Hamiltonian. No commensurability condition is assumed between the magnetic flux per unit cell and the quantum of magnetic flux. We construct a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state (NEASS) which \"dresses\" the equilibrium Fermi projection on states below the spectral gap, and models the state of the system after the addition of a weak external electric field of strength $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$. Having in mind applications to the integer quantum Hall effect, we probe the response of a current operator in the direction transverse to that of the applied electric field, and show that the resulting current density in the NEASS is linear in $\\varepsilon$, with no power-law corrections. The linear response coefficient, namely the Hall conductivity, is computed in terms of the equilibrium Fermi projection via the double-commutator formula, in accordance with the prediction from Kubo's linear response theory.\n  Our results generalize the methods and findings of [Lett. Math. Phys. 112 (2022), 91] to the setting of uniform magnetic fields with incommensurate magnetic flux per unit cell, and to lattice-periodic perturbation of such magnetic fields.",

Specifically, for sufficiently smooth functions, the resulting discretizations achieve high-order convergence with orders $p=4, 6, 8$. The discrete operators lead to Toeplitz stiffness matrices, allowing efficient matrix-vector multiplications via fast algorithms. Building on these approximations, HFD methods are formulated for solving TFL equations, and their stability and convergence are rigorously analyzed.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates information freshness in a remote estimation system in which the remote information source is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). For such systems, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators in which the remote estimate at any time is equal to the value of the most recently received update. This is mainly due to the simplicity and ease of analysis of martingale estimators, which however are far from optimal, especially in query-based (i.e., pull-based) update systems. In such systems, maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimal. However, MAP estimators can be challenging to analyze in continuous-time settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which can seamlessly shift from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator, enabling them to retain useful characteristics of the MAP estimate, while still being analytically tractable. Particularly, we introduce a new estimator termed as the $p$-MAP estimator which is a piecewise-constant approximation of the MAP estimator with finitely many discontinuities, bringing us closer to a full characterization of MAP estimators when modeling information freshness. In fact, we show that for time-reversible CTMCs, the MAP estimator reduces to a $p$-MAP estimator. Using the binary freshness (BF) process for the characterization of information freshness, we derive the freshness expressions and provide optimal state-dependent sampling policies (i.e., querying policies) for maximizing the mean BF (MBF) for pull-based remote estimation of a single CTMC information source, when structured estimators are used. Moreover, we provide optimal query rate allocation policies when a monitor pulls information from multiple heterogeneous CTMCs with a constraint on the overall query rate.",

In this paper we show that this is actually the case, improving the state of the art that only offers non-canonical chain complexes. Technically, we achieve this result considering the \u010cech homology spectral sequence of the unstable manifolds filtration.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study discrete Lyapunov models, which consist of steady-state distributions of first-order vector autoregressive models. The parameter matrix of such a model encodes a directed graph whose vertices correspond to the components of the random vector. This combinatorial framework naturally allows for cycles in the graph structure. We focus on the fundamental problem of identifying the entries of the parameter matrix. In contrast to the classical setting, we assume non-Gaussian error terms, which allows us to use the higher-order cumulants of the model. In this setup, we show generic identifiability for directed acyclic graphs with self-loops at each vertex and show how to express the parameters as a rational function of the cumulants. Furthermore, we establish local identifiability for all directed graphs containing self loops at each vertex and no isolated vertices. Finally, we provide first results on the defining equations of the models, showing model equivalence for certain graphs and paving the way towards structure learning.",

    "abstract": "Physical computing exploits unconventional physical substrates to overcome limitations such as the high energy consumption inherent in digital computation. However, intrinsic noise and temporal fluctuations (e.g., oscillations) generally deteriorate computational performance. Here, we propose ensemble reservoir computing (ERC), a novel framework that employs ensemble averaging of spatially multiplexed systems to achieve robust information processing despite noise and temporal fluctuations. First, we prove that ensemble averaging in ERC eliminates temporal fluctuations and noise from dynamical states under certain conditions, thereby restoring computational performance to its noise-free level. Next, we show that ERC not only removes the noise and fluctuations but also actively exploits the computational capabilities that conventional reservoir computing (RC) leaves unutilized. This computational enhancement is demonstrated across diverse dynamical systems (e.g., periodic, chaotic, and strange-nonchaotic systems), in which ERC outperforms conventional RC. Finally, using energy-efficient spin-torque oscillators (STOs), we demonstrate that ERC maintains high performance even under realistic conditions, in which noise and temporal fluctuations coexist: STOs with ERC achieved 99\\% accuracy on an error detection test, where conventional STO reservoir with linear regression only shows a chance level performance, highlighting ERC's robustness and performance gains for physical systems.",

Traditionally, this space is a subspace of a fixed ambient reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), determined solely by the chosen kernel and the dataset, whose elements identify the basis elements. Consequently, the projection operator underlying the kernel method depends on the loss function, the dataset, and the choice of ambient RKHS. In this study, we consider kernel methods whose solution spaces also depend on learnable parameters that are independent of the dataset. The resulting methods can be viewed as variable projection operators that depend on the loss function, the dataset, and the new learnable parameters instead of a fixed RKHS. This work has two main contributions. First, we propose an efficient approximation of kernels associated with infinite-dimensional RKHSs, commonly used to reduce the solution-space dimension for large datasets. Second, we construct fixed-dimensional, parameter-dependent solution spaces that enable highly efficient kernel models suitable for large-scale problems without the need to approximate kernels of infinite-dimensional RKHSs. Our novel family of adaptive kernel methods generalizes earlier approaches, including Random Fourier Features, and we demonstrate their effectiveness through several numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "Matching platforms, from ridesharing to food delivery to competitive gaming, face a fundamental operational dilemma: match agents immediately to minimize waiting costs, or delay to exploit the efficiency gains of thicker markets. Yet computing optimal policies is generally intractable, sophisticated algorithms often rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, and common heuristics lack worst-case performance guarantees. We formulate a versatile framework for multi-sided matching with general state-dependent cost structures and non-stationary arrival dynamics. Central to our approach is a cost-balancing principle: match when accumulated waiting cost reaches a calibrated proportion of instantaneous matching cost. This equilibrium condition emerges from fluid-limit analysis and motivates a simple, adaptive Cost-Balancing (CB) algorithm requiring no distributional assumptions. We prove that CB achieves a competitive ratio of $(1+\\sqrt\u0393)$ under adversarial arrivals, where $\u0393$ quantifies economies of scale, guaranteeing cost within a constant factor of the offline optimum. In contrast, standard greedy and threshold policies can incur unbounded costs in adversarial scenarios. We further establish a universal lower bound of $(\\sqrt{5}+1)/2$ (the golden ratio), quantifying the fundamental price of uncertainty in online matching. Experiments on game matchmaking and real-world food delivery data demonstrate practical effectiveness, with CB consistently outperforming industry-standard heuristics.",

As a result, the distortion function depends not only on the instantaneous distortion between a source symbol and its representation symbol, but also on past representations. In this paper, we give a formal definition of this problem and introduce both inner (achievable) and outer bounds on the rate-distortion tradeoff. We also discuss convexification of the problem, which makes it easier to find bounds. Problems of this type arise in biological information processing, as well as in recommendation engines; we provide an example applied to a simplified biological information processing problem.",

    "abstract": "Diagonalizability plays an important role in the analysis and design of multivariable systems. A structured matrix is called structurally diagonalizable if almost all of its numerical realizations, obtained by assigning real values to its free entries, are diagonalizable. Structural diagonalizability is useful for the verification and optimization of various structural system properties. In this paper, we study the asymptotic probability distribution of structural diagonalizability for structured systems whose system matrices are represented by directed Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs. Leveraging a recently established graph-theoretic characterization of structural diagonalizability, we analyze the distribution of structurally diagonalizable graphs under different edge-density regimes. For dense graphs, we prove that the system is almost always structurally diagonalizable. For graphs of medium density, we derive tight upper and lower bounds on the asymptotic probability of structural diagonalizability. For extremely sparse graphs, we show that this probability approaches 0. The theoretical results are validated through extensive numerical simulations with varying numbers of vertices and connection probabilities.",

    "abstract": "We study the long-time behavior of a particle in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \\geq 2$, subject to molecular diffusion and advection by a random incompressible flow. The velocity field is the divergence of a stationary random stream matrix $\\mathbf{k} $ with positive Hurst exponent $\u03b3> 0$, so the resulting random environment is multiscale and self-similar. In the perturbative regime $\u03b3\\ll 1$, we prove quenched power-law superdiffusion: for a typical realization of the environment, the displacement variance at time $t$ grows like $t^{2/(2-\u03b3)}$, the scaling predicted by renormalization group heuristics. We also identify the leading prefactor up to a random (quenched) relative error of order $\u03b3^{\\frac12}\\left| \\log \u03b3\\right|^3$. The proof implements a Wilsonian renormalization group scheme at the level of the infinitesimal generator $\\nabla \\cdot (\u03bdI_d + \\mathbf{k} ) \\nabla$, based on a self-similar induction across scales. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained generator is well-approximated, at each scale $r$, by a constant-coefficient Laplacian with effective diffusivity growing like $r^\u03b3$. This approximation is inherently scale-local: reflecting the multifractal nature of the environment, the relative error does not decay with the scale, but remains of order $\u03b3^{\\frac12}\\left| \\log \u03b3\\right|^2$. We also prove anomalous regularization under the quenched law: for almost every realization of the drift, solutions of the associated elliptic equation are H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent $1 - C\u03b3^{\\frac12}$ and satisfy estimates which are uniform in the molecular diffusivity $\u03bd$ and the scale.",

In contrast, we demonstrate with examples in both zero and non-zero characteristic of the base field that the class of exact module categories is not stable under this product. We also observe in examples that fully exact module categories form a dense subset in the class of exact ones.\n  The monoidal 2-category of fully exact module categories strictly contains those of invertible and separable module categories. In fact, we show that each internal algebra of a fully exact module category is projectively separable, a generalization of separable algebras involving projective objects. In the semisimple case, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is separable.\n  In general, fully exact module categories are not dualizable inside their class, but if they are, they are fully dualizable objects in the monoidal 2-category of finite module categories. We call such module categories perfect. We show that perfect module categories form a rigid monoidal 2-subcategory containing all fully dualizable objects. Therefore, we propose perfect module categories as a model for finite tensor 2-categories. If the braiding is symmetric, a module category is fully exact if and only if it is perfect.\n  As a detailed example, we classify fully exact, and hence perfect, module categories over the symmetric tensor category of modules over Sweedler's four-dimensional Hopf algebra and compute their relative Deligne products, and the categories of 1-morphisms. For a general quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, we analyze when the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces is fully exact. We show that this is not the case for both Sweedler's Hopf algebra and Lusztig's factorizable small quantum group of type $A_1$ at an odd root of unity.",

    "abstract": "The reconstruction and inference of stochastic dynamical systems from data is a fundamental task in inverse problems and statistical learning. While surrogate modeling advances computational methods to approximate these dynamics, standard approaches typically require high-fidelity training data. In many practical settings, the data are indirectly observed through noisy and nonlinear measurement. The challenge lies not only in approximating the coefficients of the SDEs, but in simultaneously inferring the posterior updates given the observations. In this work, we present a neural path estimation approach to solve stochastic dynamical systems based on variational inference. We first derive a stochastic control problem that solve filtering posterior path measure corresponding to a pathwise Zakai equation. We then construct a generative model that maps the prior path measure to posterior measure through the controlled diffusion and the associated Randon-Nykodym derivative. Through an amortization of sample paths of the observation process, the control is learned by an embedding of the noisy observation paths. Thus, we learn the unknown prior SDE and the control can recover the conditional path measure given the observation sample paths and we learn an associated SDE which induces the same path measure. In the end, we perform experiments on nonlinear dynamical systems, demonstrating the model's ability to learn multimodal, chaotic, or high dimensional systems.",

In the traditional framework, ruin occurs when the surplus process first reaches zero. In contrast, default in our model may also arise when the surplus spends an excessive amount of time below a distress threshold, even without ever hitting zero. This occupation-time-based default criterion captures financial distress more realistically, as prolonged periods of low liquidity or capitalisation may trigger regulatory intervention or operational failure. The resulting optimisation problem is formulated as a new singular stochastic control problem with discontinuous state-dependent discounting and killing. We provide a complete analytical solution via a bespoke sequential guess-and-verify method and identify three distinct classes of optimal dividend strategies corresponding to different parameter regimes of the dual-ruin structure. Notably, for certain distress thresholds, the optimal policy features disconnected action and inaction regions. We further show that, unlike in the classical dividend problem, higher effective discounting induced by occupation time below a distress level can lead to delayed, rather than earlier, dividend payments.",

In parallel with the complexity analysis, we introduce a general framework for systematically studying higher-order regularity on Riemannian manifolds that characterizes its joint dependence on the objective function and the chosen retraction. To the best of our knowledge, this framework constitutes the first known application in optimization of pullback connections and the Sasaki metric to the study of retraction-based pullbacks of the objective function. We provide clean derivative bounds based on a new covariant Fa\u00e0 di Bruno formula derived within our framework. For $p=3$, our methods are fully implementable via a new Krylov-based framework for minimizing quartically regularized cubic polynomials.

    "title": "On Approximate Computation of Critical Points",
    "abstract": "We show that computing even very coarse approximations of critical points is intractable for simple classes of nonconvex functions. More concretely, we prove that if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a polynomial in $n$ variables of constant degree (as low as three) and outputs a point whose gradient has Euclidean norm at most $2^n$ whenever the polynomial has a critical point, then P=NP. The algorithm is permitted to return an arbitrary point when no critical point exists. We also prove hardness results for approximate computation of critical points under additional structural assumptions, including settings in which existence and uniqueness of a critical point are guaranteed, the function is lower bounded, and approximation is measured in terms of distance to a critical point. Overall, our results stand in contrast to the commonly-held belief that, in nonconvex optimization, approximate computation of critical points is a tractable task.",

Despite the practical success of the tensor ring (TR) decomposition, its intrinsic geometry remains less understood, primarily due to the underlying ring structure and the resulting nontrivial gauge invariance. We establish the quotient geometry of TR decomposition by imposing full-rank conditions on all unfolding matrices of the core tensors and capturing the gauge invariance. Additionally, the results can be extended to the uniform TR decomposition, where all core tensors are identical. Numerical experiments validate the developed geometries via tensor ring completion tasks.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental trade-off between privacy and utility remains an active area of research. Our contribution is motivated by two observations. First, privacy mechanisms developed for one-time data release cannot straightforwardly be extended to sequential releases. Second, practical databases are likely to be useful to multiple distinct parties. Furthermore, we can not rule out the possibility of data sharing between parties. With utility in mind, we formulate a privacy-utility trade-off problem to adaptively tackle sequential data requests made by different, potentially colluding entities. We consider both expected distortion and mutual information as measures to quantify utility, and use mutual information to measure privacy. We assume an attack model whereby illicit data sharing, which we call collusion, can occur between data receivers. We develop an adaptive algorithm for data releases that makes use of a modified Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. We show that the resulting data releases are optimal when expected distortion quantifies utility, and locally optimal when mutual information quantifies utility. Finally, we discuss how our findings may extend to applications in machine learning.",

    "title": "Unique Continuation Property for Stochastic Wave Equations",
    "abstract": "This paper establishes a fundamental and surprising phenomenon in the theory of stochastic wave equations: the restoration of the unique continuation property (UCP) across characteristic hypersurfaces, a property that is known to fail generically in the deterministic setting. We prove that if a solution to a linear stochastic wave equation vanishes on one side of a characteristic surface $\u0393$, then it must vanish in a full neighborhood of any point on $\u0393$, provided the stochastic diffusion coefficient is non-degenerate. This result stands in sharp contrast to the classical H\u00f6rmander-type counterexamples for deterministic waves.\n  Furthermore, we extend the UCP to equations with non-homogeneous stochastic sources and establish a global unique continuation result from the interior of an arbitrarily narrow characteristic cone. Our proofs rely on a novel stochastic Carleman estimate, where the It\u00f4 diffusion term introduces a crucial positive energy contribution that is absent in deterministic models.\n  These findings demonstrate a qualitative difference between deterministic and stochastic hyperbolic dynamics and open new avenues for control theory and inverse problems in stochastic setting.",

This is an affine analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism in the finite case.\n  The key ingredient of the proof is the identification of the center with the Heisenberg coset of the regular W-superalgebra of $\\mathfrak{gl}_{n|1}$ at the critical level, whose associated graded algebra is realized as the affine supersymmetric polynomials. Based on this, we derive a character formula for the center, which coincides with the generating function of plane partitions with a pit condition. We also prove that the Heisenberg coset at generic levels has a similar interpretation in terms of pseudo-differential operators that deform the one at the critical level.",

    "abstract": "Simplicial type theory extends homotopy type theory and equips types with a notion of directed morphisms. A Segal type is defined to be a type in which these directed morphisms can be composed. We show that all higher coherences can be stated and derived if simplicial type theory is taken to be homotopy type theory with a postulated interval type. In technical terms, this means that if a type has unique fillers for $(2,1)$-horns, it has unique fillers for all inner $(n,k)$-horns. This generalizes a result of Riehl and Shulman for the case $n = 3, k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. Our main technical tool is the Leibniz adjunction: the pushout-product is left adjoint to the pullback-hom in the wild category of types. While this adjunction is well known for ordinary categories, it is much more involved for higher categories, and the fact that it can be proved for the wild category of types (a higher category without stated higher coherences) is non-trivial. We make profitable use of the equivalence between the wild category of maps and that of families. We have formalized the results in Cubical Agda.",

    "title": "ZOBA: An Efficient Single-loop Zeroth-order Bilevel Optimization Algorithm",
    "abstract": "Bilevel optimization problems consist of minimizing a value function whose evaluation depends on the solution of an inner optimization problem. These problems are typically tackled using first-order methods that require computing the gradient of the value function ({\\it the hypergradient}). In several practical settings, however, first-order information is unavailable ({\\it zeroth-order setting}), rendering these methods inapplicable. Finite-difference methods provide an alternative by approximating hypergradients using function evaluations along a set of directions. Nevertheless, such surrogates are notoriously expensive, and existing finite-difference bilevel methods rely on two-loop algorithms that are poorly parallelizable. In this work, we propose ZOBA, the first finite-difference single-loop algorithm for bilevel optimization. Our method leverages finite-difference hypergradient approximations based on delayed information to eliminate the need for nested loops. We analyze the proposed algorithm and establish convergence rates in the non-convex setting, achieving a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(p(d + p)^2\\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $p$ and $d$ denote the dimension of inner and outer spaces respectively, which is better than prior approaches based on Hessian approximation. We further introduce and analyze HF-ZOBA, a Hessian-free variant that yields additional complexity improvements. Finally, we corroborate our findings with numerical experiments on synthetic functions and a real-world black-box task in adversarial machine learning. Our results show that our methods achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art techniques while requiring less computation time.",

It also arises in the context of gradient-based methods for optimization problems that feature matrix functions, e.g., when fitting an evolution equation to an observed solution trajectory. In principle, the well-known identity \\[\n  f\\left( \\begin{bmatrix}\n  A & E \\\\ 0 & A\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\right) \\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 \\\\ \\vc{b}\n  \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  L_f(A, E) \\vc{b} \\\\ f(A) \\vc{b}\n  \\end{bmatrix}, \\] allows one to directly apply any standard Krylov subspace method, such as the Arnoldi algorithm, to address this task. However, this comes with the major disadvantage that the involved block triangular matrix has unfavorable spectral properties, which impede the convergence analysis and, to a certain extent, also the observed convergence. To avoid these difficulties, we propose a novel modification of the Arnoldi algorithm that aims at better preserving the block triangular structure. In turn, this allows one to bound the convergence of the modified method by the best polynomial approximation of the derivative $f^\\prime$ on the numerical range of $A$. Several numerical experiments illustrate our findings.",

Our analysis is motivated by the challenge of solving fully nonlinear Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equations in high dimensions by means of a Neural Network, which is trained by minimizing residuals arising from monotone discretizations of the Hamiltonian. While classical theory ensures that consistency and monotonicity imply convergence to the viscosity solution, treating these discrete systems as optimization problems introduces new analytical hurdles: solvability and the uniqueness of local minima do not follow from monotonicity alone.\n  By establishing the well--posedness of these optimization--based solvers, our framework enables the adaptation of Level Set Methods to high--dimensional settings, unlocking new capabilities in applications such as high--dimensional segmentation and interface tracking. Finally, we observe that these arguments extend almost directly to degenerate elliptic or parabolic PDEs on graphs equipped with monotone graph Laplacians.",
