    "abstract": "We investigate the interplay among three key properties of bounded linear operators between Banach spaces: the Bhatia-\u0160emrl property, strong subdifferentiability and the condition that the essential norm is strictly less than the operator norm. For a Hilbert space $H$ and for $1<p,q<\\infty$, we show that for any operator in $B(H)$ and $B(\\ell_p, \\ell_q)$, the essential norm is strictly less than the operator norm if and only if it is the point of strong subdifferentiability of the norm and its norm-attainment set is compact. Moreover, for operators in these spaces that satisfy the Bhatia-\u0160emrl property, we show that their essential norm must be strictly less than their operator norm. We also study norm one projections satisfying the Bhatia-\u0160emrl property and provide examples of operators that possess this property.",

    "title": "Metric mean dimension and the variational principle for actions of amenable groups",
    "abstract": "Metric mean dimension is a dynamical counterpart of the box dimension in fractal geometry to characterize the topological complexity of infinite entropy systems. The classical variational principle states that topological entropy equals the supremum of measure-theoretic entropy over the set of invariant measures. Lindenstrauss and Tsukamoto proved that this variational principle fails for metric mean dimension in terms of rate-distortion dimensions. For the actions of amenable groups, we define a new measure-theoretic metric mean dimension for invariant measures and establish a classical-type variational principle for metric mean dimension. In particular, we extend the Lindenstrauss-Tsukamoto variational principles to the classical variational principle by defining modified rate-distortion dimensions.\n  As applications, for systems with zero metric mean dimension, we introduce infinite entropy dimensions in both topological and measure-theoretic settings, and relate them via a variational principle. For systems with positive metric mean dimension, we introduce local metric mean dimension from a local perspective, and relate it to the metric mean dimension of the whole phase space via variational principles.",

    "title": "Historical Information Accelerates Decentralized Optimization: A Proximal Bundle Method",
    "abstract": "Historical information, such as past function values or gradients, has significant potential to enhance decentralized optimization methods for two key reasons: first, it provides richer information about the objective function, which also explains its established success in centralized optimization; second, unlike the second-order derivative or its alternatives, historical information has already been computed or communicated and requires no additional cost to acquire. Despite this potential, it remains underexploited. In this work, we employ a proximal bundle framework to incorporate the function values and gradients at historical iterates and adapt the framework to the proximal decentralized gradient descent method, resulting in a Decentralized Proximal Bundle Method (DPBM). To broaden its applicability, we further extend DPBM to the asynchronous and stochastic setting. We theoretically analysed the convergence of the proposed methods. Notably, both the asynchronous DPBM and its stochastic variant can converge with fixed step-sizes that are independent of delays, which is superior to the delay-dependent step-sizes required by most existing asynchronous optimization methods, as it is easier to determine and often leads to faster convergence. Numerical experiments on classification problems demonstrate that by using historical information, our methods yield faster convergence and stronger robustness in the step-sizes.",

    "abstract": "Continuous data assimilation methods, such as the nudging algorithm introduced by Azouani, Olson, and Titi (AOT) [2], are known to be highly effective in deterministic settings for asymptotically synchronizing approximate solutions with observed dynamics. In this work, we extend this framework to a stochastic regime by considering the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to either additive or multiplicative noise. We establish sufficient conditions on the nudging parameter and the spatial observation scale that guarantee convergence of the nudged solution to the true stochastic flow.\n  In the case of multiplicative noise, convergence holds in expectation, with exponential or polynomial rates depending on the growth of the noise covariance. For additive noise, we obtain the exponential convergence both in expectation and pathwise. These results yield a stochastic generalization of the AOT theory, demonstrating how the interplay between random forcing, viscous dissipation and feedback control governs synchronization in stochastic fluid systems.",

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has expanded its host range with recent detections in dairy cattle, raising critical concerns regarding within-herd persistence and cross-species spillover. This study develops a stochastic $SEI_sI_aR-B$ compartmental model to analyse HPAI transmission, explicitly accounting for environmental pathogen reservoirs and noise intensities through Wiener processes. The positivity and boundedness of solutions are established, and the disease-free and endemic equilibria are analytically derived. The basic reproduction number is determined using the next-generation matrix method. Numerical simulations confirm that the model dynamics are consistent with theoretical analysis and illustrate how stochastic fluctuations significantly influence disease persistence. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC) identifies the transmission rate from asymptomatic infectious cattle ($\u03b2_a$) as the primary driver of transmission. The model effectively captures the dynamics of environmental variability affecting HPAI spread, suggesting that effective control strategies must prioritise the early detection and isolation of asymptomatic carriers alongside environmental management.",

    "abstract": "In the high-Reynolds-number regime, this work investigates the long-time dynamics of the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations near the Oseen vortex filament. The flow exhibits a strong interplay between vortex stretching, shearing, and mixing, which generates ever-smaller spatial scales and thereby significantly amplifies viscous effects. By adopting an anisotropic self-similar coordinate system adapted to the filament geometry, we establish the nonlinear asymptotic stability of the Oseen vortex filament. All non-axisymmetric perturbations are shown to decay at the optimal rate $t^{-\u03ba|\u03b1|^{1/2}}$. At the linear level, this decay mechanism corresponds to a sharp spectral lower bound $\u03a3(\u03b1) \\sim |\u03b1|^{1/2}$ for the nonlocal Oseen operator $L_\\perp - \u03b1\u039b_\\perp$, and we identify an explicit spectral point attaining this optimal bound. Combined with the spectral estimates obtained in \\cite{LWZ}, our analysis fully resolves the conjecture proposed in \\cite{GM} concerning the asymptotic scaling laws for the spectral and pseudospectral bounds $\u03a3(\u03b1)$ and $\u03a8(\u03b1)$. These results provide a rigorous mathematical explanation for the shear-mixing mechanism in the vicinity of the 3D Oseen vortex filament.",

We prove this conjecture unconditionally.\n  Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $\u03c1_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{\u03bc\u03bc} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof.\n  We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization.",

We also provide quantitative estimates relating the moduli of uniform continuity of the maps to the dimension of the spaces. This gives partial answers to a question of W. B.

Our results also apply to more general spaces other than $\\ell_1$ such as spaces with unconditional bases which are not equivalent to the standard $c_0$ basis.

In this setting, we show that for sequences the associated notion of Bourgain-uo convergence coincides with ordinary order convergence. Motivated by Bourgain's construction, we introduce a strengthened, subsequence-invariant notion of Cauchy sequence: a sequence $(x_n)$ in a vector lattice $E$ is called Buo-Cauchy if for every strictly increasing sequence $(n_k)$ the differences $x_{n_{k+1}}-x_{n_k}$ converge to $0$ in order in $E$. We study the resulting sequential completeness problem in several concrete Banach lattices.\n  Our main results are twofold. On the positive side, we prove that the classical sequence lattices $c_0$ and $\\ell_\\infty$ are sequentially Buo-complete: every Buo-Cauchy sequence converges in order, and hence in the Buo sense. In addition, we establish a sharp metric characterisation for bounded Lipschitz function lattices: the vector lattice $\\mathrm{Lip}_b(X)$ of bounded Lipschitz functions on a metric space $(X,d)$ is sequentially \\Buo-complete if and only if $X$ is uniformly discrete.\n  On the negative side, we show that vector lattices of continuous or Lipschitz functions over metric spaces with non-isolated points fail sequential Buo-completeness.

    "abstract": "The Lorenz attractor is the first example of a robustly chaotic non-hyperbolic attractor. Each orbit of such an attractor has a positive top Lyapunov exponent, and this property persists under small perturbations despite possible bifurcations of the attractor. In this paper, we study the boundary of the Lorenz attractor existence region in the Shimizu-Morioka model. As in the classical Lorenz system, a part of the boundary is associated with the curve $l_{A=0}$, where the first tangency between some Lyapunov subspaces occurs along orbits of the attractor. However, in the Lorenz system, the curve $l_{A=0}$ forms the exact boundary of the Lorenz attractor existence region. Beyond this curve, the attractor is not robustly chaotic, although it may be indistinguishable from the Lorenz attractor in simple numerical experiments. In the Shimizu-Morioka model, the curve $l_{A=0}$ is divided into two parts. The Lorenz attractor existence region adjoins $l_{A=0}$ along the first part of this curve, as in the Lorenz system. Near the second part, as we show, the region of the existence of the Lorenz attractor is fractal. We describe two infinite cascades of disjoint subregions with the Lorenz attractor. One cascade occurs along the curve $l_{A=0}$, another -- in the transversal direction. We show that along the cascades, the Lorenz attractor undergoes ``doubling bifurcations'', leading to a complication of its topological structure.",

In this problem, the decision maker considers items for which either weights or values, or both, are random. The aim is to select a subset of these items to be included into their knapsack. We study both \"static\" and \"dynamic\" variants of this problem: in the static setting, the decision about which items should be included in the knapsack is taken at the outset, before any random item value or weight is revealed; in the dynamic setting, items are received sequentially, and the decision about a particular item is made by taking into account previously observed values and weights. The knapsack has a given capacity, and if the total realised weight exceeds this capacity then a penalty cost is incurred for each unit of excess capacity utilised. The goal is to maximise the expected net profit. We tackle the case of normally distributed item weights and we show that our approach extends seamlessly to the case in which item weights are correlated and follow a multivariate normal distribution. In addition, we show our approach represents an effective heuristic for the case in which item weights follow generic probability distributions. In an extensive computational study we demonstrate that our models are near-optimal and more scalable than other state-of-the-art approaches.",

In solution reconstruction, parameters of a physical model are estimated from sparse measurement data as a means to obtain the full solution field. In contrast, inverse problems target the missing parameters and estimate the solution along the way. Noting the similarity of the mathematical formulations of these two tasks, we investigate the use of ECFM to solve inverse problems. First, we compare the ECFM formulation of the inverse problem to a standard approach using two numerical examples. The first example provides an extension of ECFM to dynamic problems, and the second offers a novel approach to treat noisy measurement data. Next, we introduce a method to solve inverse problems for which the parameterized model has stochastic components. This approach is based on constraint forces and the polynomial chaos expansion, and is illustrated with another numerical example. Finally, we discuss extensions of ECFM to recover missing boundary conditions and domain geometries from measurement data, which are shown to be special cases of problems treated previously in the literature. The purpose of this work is to extend the mathematical framework of ECFM to novel applications and to gauge the method's viability as an alternative strategy for inverse analysis.",

Our work focuses on local quadratic approximations of the associated Gaussian fields. Local quadratic approximations to random fields are random polynomials parametrized by a jointly sampled gradient vector and Hessian matrix. We characterize the distribution of the corresponding random vectors and random matrices. Then, we study the error in the quadratic approximation, which is also a Gaussian field. We investigate the error induced by the quadratic approximation in three senses: the pointwise error, the maximal error over an ellipsoidal region, and the worst-case error for multivariate Gaussian inputs at a given confidence level. Next, we explore the limiting behavior of the worst-case error as the distance between an expansion point and evaluation points approaches zero and infinity. Finally, we study how, as the input dimension increases, the variance of multivariate Gaussian distributions must be restricted to keep the worst-case error bound constant.",

    "abstract": "Ambient backscatter communications (AmBC), where a backscatter transmitter (BT) modulates and reflects ambient signals to a backscatter receiver (BR), have been deemed a low-power communication technology for the Internet of Things. Previous work on symbol detection in AmBC assumed perfect time synchronization (TS), which is unrealistic in practice. The residual TS errors (RTSE) cause \\emph{partial sample mismatch}, degrading symbol detection performance. To address this, we propose a new AmBC symbol detection framework that incorporates the BT's current and adjacent symbols, as well as channel coefficients. Using energy detector (ED) as a case study, we derive both exact and approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions. Our results show that the ED's BER performance degrades significantly under RTSE, with the symbol detection threshold optimized under the assumption of perfect TS. We then derive a closed-form expression for a near-optimal symbol detection threshold that minimizes BER under RTSE. To estimate the required parameters for the detection threshold, we propose a novel method exploiting the attributes of the BR's received signal samples. The analytical results are verified by simulation results.",

To address the analytical difficulties associated with solving HJB equations and stationary distributions in high-dimensional state spaces under regime switching, we construct a numerical approximation scheme for the optimal strategy function based on Markov chains and neural networks. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of the corresponding sequence of surplus processes and rigorously prove that the associated optimal values converge to the true value function.

Within a kinetic modeling framework, we describe the evolution of the coupled dynamics of opinions and network structure, incorporating a class of control laws in order to promote interactions with popular individuals and amplify dominant opinions. Such control strategies are introduced to influence both opinion formation and connectivity, representing interventions such as awareness campaigns or moderation policies. Numerical results show how control strategies can mitigate polarization, foster consensus, or guide opinion distributions in dynamically evolving networks.",

For general matrices, we establish determinant identities for bordered Gramian matrices that decompose CUR approximation errors into interpretable local components. These identities connect projection errors onto submatrix column spaces directly to determinants, providing geometric insight into approximation degradation. We develop a probabilistic framework based on volume sampling that yields interpolation-type error bounds quantifying the benefits of oversampling: when $r > k$ rows are selected for $k$ columns, the expected error factor transitions linearly from $(k+1)^2$ (no oversampling) to $(k+1)$ (full oversampling). Our analysis establishes that the expected squared error is bounded by this interpolation factor times the squared error of the best rank-$k$ approximation, directly connecting CUR approximation quality to the optimal low-rank approximation. The framework applies to both CUR decomposition for general matrices and the Nystr\u00f6m method for symmetric positive semi-definite matrices, providing a unified theoretical foundation for determinant-based low-rank approximation analysis.",

Since then, for the two-dimensional viscous or inviscid shallow water equations, the global existence of smooth solutions with arbitrarily large initial data has remained a challenging and long-standing open problem. In this paper, we provide an affirmative resolution to the viscous problem under the assumption of two-dimensional radial symmetry. Specifically, we establish the global existence of smooth solutions for the two-dimensional radially symmetric viscous shallow water equations with arbitrary smooth initial data. To achieve this goal, our approach relies crucially on overcoming two major obstacles: first, treating the viscous Saint-Venant system as the endpoint case of the BD entropy condition for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations; and second, addressing the critical embedding imposed by the spatial dimension, which currently holds only in two dimensions. However, the same result can be extended to three dimension for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying general BD entropy conditions excluding the endpoint case. Indeed, under the same symmtric framework, we also prove the global existence of smooth solutions for arbitrarily large initial data for both the two- and three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations subject to the BD entropy condition. It is particularly noteworthy that the aforementioned shallow water equations precisely correspond to the endpoint case of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy condition.",

In this note, we show that for certain test functions we can instead use more traditional derivatives, which simplifies the bounds for the Stein factors and is more amenable to the approximation of the inclusion process.",

(ii) We give an explicit formula of Fourier coefficients of Jacobi-Eisenstein series of index $D_{2n+1}$. (iii) We construct a holomorphic modular form of weight $3/2$ of level $8$ from the Zagier Eisenstein series $\\mathscr{F}$ of weight $3/2$ of level $4$. Moreover, we show that the four functions $E^*_2$, $\u03b7^3$, $\u03b8^3$ and $\\mathscr{F}$ have essentially the same Hecke eigenvalue $1+p$ for any odd prime $p$, where $E^*_2$ is the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight $2$, $\u03b7$ is the Dedekind eta-function and $\u03b8$ is the usual theta function.

    "abstract": "Coupling within-host infection dynamics with population-level transmission remains a major challenge in infectious disease modeling, especially for airborne pathogens with potential to spread indoor. The frequent emergence of such diseases highlight the need for integrated frameworks that capture both individual-level infection kinetics and between-host transmission. While analytical models for each scale exist, tractable approaches that link them remain limited. In this study, we present a novel multiscale mathematical framework that integrates within-host infection kinetics with airborne transmission dynamics. The model represents each host as a patch and couples a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing in-host infection kinetics with a diffusion-based partial differential equation (PDE) for airborne pathogen movement in enclosed spaces. These scales are linked through boundary conditions on each patch boundary, representing viral shedding and inhalation. Using matched asymptotic analysis in the regime of intermediate diffusivity, we derived a nonlinear ODE model from the coupled ODE-PDE system that retains spatial heterogeneity through Neumann Green's functions. We established the existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of solutions to the reduced model and analyzed within-host infection kinetics as functions of the airborne pathogen diffusion rate and host spatial configuration. In the well-mixed limit, the model recovers the classical target cell limited viral dynamics framework. Overall, the proposed multiscale modeling approach enables the simultaneous study of transient within-host infection dynamics and population-level disease spread, providing a tractable yet biologically grounded framework for investigating airborne disease transmission in indoor environments.",

In contrast to the standard step-and-truncate approach, this method updates the tensor cores through a sweeping procedure, allowing the use of relatively small TT-ranks and leading to substantial reductions in memory usage and computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several representative kinetic equations.",

    "abstract": "Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has been considered as a promising waveform to enable high-reliable connectivity in the internet of vehicles. However, accurate channel estimation is critical and challenging to achieve the expected performance of the AFDM systems in doubly-dispersive channels. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for AFDM systems and develop a dynamic grid update strategy with two off-grid channel estimation methods, i.e., grid-refinement SBL (GR-SBL) and grid-evolution SBL (GE-SBL) estimators. Specifically, the GR-SBL employs a localized grid refinement method and dynamically updates grid for a high-precision estimation. The GE-SBL estimator approximates the off-grid components via first-order linear approximation and enables gradual grid evolution for estimation accuracy enhancement. Furthermore, we develop a distributed computing scheme to decompose the large-dimensional channel estimation model into multiple manageable small-dimensional sub-models for complexity reduction of GR-SBL and GE-SBL, denoted as distributed GR-SBL (D-GR-SBL) and distributed GE-SBL (D-GE-SBL) estimators, which also support parallel processing to reduce the computational latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimators outperform existing competitive schemes. The GR-SBL estimator achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes at the cost of high complexity, while the GE-SBL estimator provides a better trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL estimators effectively reduce complexity and maintain comparable performance to GR-SBL and GE-SBL estimators, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is widely used in applications such as MRI, CT, and interferometry; however, because of its dependence on uniformly sampled data, it requires the use of gridding techniques for practical implementation. The performance of these algorithms strongly depends on the choice of the gridding kernel, with the first prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF) regarded as optimal. This work redefines kernel optimality through the lens of vector optimization (VO), introducing a rigorous framework that characterizes optimal kernels as Pareto-efficient solutions of an error shape operator. We establish the continuity of such operator, study the existence of solutions, and propose a novel methodology to construct kernels tailored to a desired target error function. The approach is implemented numerically via interior-point optimization. Comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed kernels outperform both the PSWF and the state-of-the-art methods (MIRT-NUFFT) in specific regions of interest, achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in mean absolute errors. These results confirm the potential of VO-based kernel design to provide customized accuracy profiles aligned with application-specific requirements. Future research will extend this framework to multidimensional cases and relative error minimization, with potential integration of machine learning for adaptive target error selection.",

    "title": "Characterising the sets of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function",
    "abstract": "For Hilbert spaces $\\mathcal H\\subseteq L^2(\\mathbb R)$ we consider the convex sets $\\mathcal D_+(\\mathcal H)$ of Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e.~density matrices over $\\mathcal H$ with non-negative Wigner function. We investigate the topological structure of these sets, namely concerning closure, compactness, interior and boundary (in a relative topology induced by the trace norm). We also study their geometric structure and construct minimal sets of states that generate $\\mathcal D_+(\\mathcal H)$ through convex combinations. If $\\mathcal H$ is finite-dimensional, the existence of such sets follows from a central result in convex analysis, namely the Krein-Milman theorem. In the infinite-dimensional case $\\mathcal H=L^2(\\mathbb R)$ this is not so, due to lack of compactness of the set $\\mathcal D_+(\\mathcal H)$. Nevertheless, we prove that a Krein-Milman theorem holds in this case, which allows us to extend most of the results concerning the sets of generators to the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we study the relation between the finite and infinite-dimensional sets of WPS, and prove that the former provide a hierarchy of closed subsets, which are also proper faces of the latter. These results provide a basis for an operational characterisation of the extreme points of the sets of WPS, which we undertake in a companion paper. Our work offers a unified perspective on the topological and geometric properties of the sets of WPS in finite and infinite dimensions, along with explicit constructions of minimal sets of generators.",

    "title": "A Generalization of MacMahon Series via Cyclotomic Polynomials",
    "abstract": "About a century ago, P. A. MacMahon introduced a class of $q$-series, which are nowadays referred to as MacMahon series. More recently, in 2013, G. E. Andrews and S. C. F. Rose revealed the quasimodular property of these series. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of MacMahon series. Specifically, for any positive integers $t, k, N$ and a polynomial $Q(x)$, we define the series $\\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}(Q; q)$ and $\\mathcal{U}_{t, k; N}^{\\star}(Q; q)$ using the $N$-th cyclotomic polynomial. To investigate these series, we apply a decomposition formula involving the Eulerian polynomials and express the $N$-th roots of unity in terms of Gauss sums. By combining these results to derive explicit representations, we prove that our series arise as quasimodular forms of higher weight and higher level. Furthermore, we show that they can be expressed as isobaric polynomials. In particular, we show that the one-parameter generalization introduced by C. Nazaroglu, B. V. Pandey, and A. Singh arises as a special case of our theory.",

    "abstract": "In many real-world applications, optimization problems evolve continuously over time and are often subject to stochastic noise. We consider a stochastic time-varying optimization problem in which the objective function $f(x;t)$ changes continuously and only noisy gradient observations are available. In deterministic settings, the prediction-correction method that exploits the time derivative of the solution is effective for accurately tracking the solution trajectory. However, a straightforward extension to stochastic problems requires an estimate of $\\nabla_{xt} f(x;t)$ and the computation of a Hessian inverse at each step--requirements that are difficult or costly in practice. To address these issues, we propose a prediction-correction algorithm that uses a regression-based prediction step: the prediction is formed as a linear combination of recent iterates, which can be computed efficiently without estimating $\\nabla_{xt}f(x;t)$ or computing Hessian inversions. We prove a tracking-error bound for the proposed method under standard smoothness and stochastic assumptions. Numerical experiments show that the regression-based prediction improves tracking accuracy while reducing computational cost compared with existing methods.",

Despite extensive progress, most methods and analyses are tailored to the flat-spike case, offering little guidance when spike energy is unevenly distributed across the support. Motivated by this, we propose Spectral Energy Pursuit (SEP), an effective iterative scheme that repeatedly screens and reselects coordinates, with a sample complexity that adapts to the energy profile. We develop our framework around a structure function \\(s(p)\\) that quantifies how spike energy accumulates over its top \\(p\\) entries. We establish that SEP succeeds with a sample size of order \\(\\max_{1\\le p\\le k} p\\,s^2(p)\\,\\log n\\), which matches the classical \\(k^2\\log n\\) sample complexity for flat spikes and improves toward the \\(k\\log n\\) regime as the profile becomes more concentrated. As a lightweight post-processing, a single truncated power iteration is proven to enable the final estimator to attain a uniform statistical error bound. Empirical simulations across flat, power-law, and exponential signals validate that SEP adapts to profile structure without tuning and outperforms existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is conventionally applied in a black-box fashion, agnostic to the underlying geometry. In this work, we propose that using geometric information -- when available -- to assist with setting up the AMG hierarchy is beneficial, especially for solving linear systems resulting from high-order finite element discretizations. High-order problems draw considerable interest to both the scientific and engineering communities, but lack efficient solvers, at least open-source codes, tailored for unstructured high-order discretizations targeting large-scale, real-world applications. For geometric multigrid, it is known that using p-coarsening before h-coarsening can provide better scalability, but setting up p-coarsening is non-trivial in AMG. We develop a geometrically informed algebraic multigrid (GIAMG) method, as well as an associated high-performance computing program, which is able to set up a grid hierarchy that includes p-coarsening at the top grids with minimal information of the geometry from the user. A major advantage of using p-coarsening with AMG -- beyond the benefits known in the context of geometric multigrid (GMG) -- is the increased sparsification of coarse grid operators. We extensively evaluate GIAMG by testing on the 3D Helmholtz and incompressible flow problems, and demonstrate mesh-independent convergence, and excellent parallel scalability. We also compare the performance of GIAMG with existing AMG packages, including Hypre and ML.",

We extend their framework to any non-singular polarization $P$ by developing a theory of transverse differential operators associated to $P$:\n  (1) For any pair of locally free $P$-modules $E, E'$, we construct a Poincar\u00e9-Birkhoff-Witt isomorphism for the bundle $\\widetilde{D}(E, E')$ of transverse differential operators from $E$ to $E'$.

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) are promising technologies to enhance wireless communication by reconfiguring channels at the environment and transceiver sides. However, their performance is constrained by practical limitations. To address this, we propose a multi-functional antenna/surface system that leverages their complementary advantages. A rotatable IRS (R-IRS) is deployed to enhance downlink communications from a six-dimensional MA (6DMA)-equipped base station (BS) to multiple single-antenna users. To reduce the complexity of real-time channel estimation and beamforming, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average sum-rate using a two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol. Specifically, the BS antenna configuration (including position and rotation) and IRS rotation and reflection are optimized based on statistical channel state information (S-CSI), while BS transmit beamforming is designed using instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) in the short timescale. We first consider a single-user case and show that the 6DMA at the BS should form a sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both the IRS and the user, allowing efficient coordination of direct and reflected channels, while the IRS rotation achieves effective multi-path alignment. For the general multi-user case, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this, we propose an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques. A low-complexity algorithm is also proposed to reduce computational complexity. Numerical results validate the proposed system, showing significant performance gains by jointly exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom of the 6DMA-BS and R-IRS under the TTS protocol.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to explore the stochastic performance limit of large-field-size Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) in multi-hop relay networks. In our model, a source transmits a sequence of streaming messages to a destination through multiple relays subject to a delay constraint. Most previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channel which introduces only restricted types of erasure patterns, and aimed to design the optimal capacity-achieving codes. In this paper, we focus on stochastic channel where each hop is subject to i.i.d. packet erasures, and carry out stochastic analysis on the error probability of multi-hop RLSCs. Our contributions are three-folds. Firstly, the error event of large-field-size RLSCs is characterized in two-hop relay network with a novel framework, which features quantification of information flowing through each node in the network. Due to the erasures in different hops, some source symbols can be \"detained\" at the source or relay while others have arrived at the destination. By iteratively computing the number of detained symbols at each node, this framework extends the concept \"information debt\" from point-to-point network [Pinwen Su et al. 2022] into two-hop relay networks. Secondly, based on the error event, the expression of average error probability in two-hop network is derived by carefully analyzing the expectation terms. To handle the expectation over all possible erasure patterns along two hops of the network, the transition matrices of the detained symbols are novelly constructed in a \"band fashion\" with nested structure. Thirdly, the derived results in two-hop network are further generalized into relay networks with arbitrary number of hops. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our stochastic analysis, and compare with some existing streaming codes for the adversarial channels.",

The connection facilitates the study of analysis of the contact instanton equation which ranges from local elliptic priori estimates, for both the interior [OW2,OW3] and the boundary [OY], to the generic perturbation theory of the asymptotic operators [KO], which also encompasses the case of pseudoholomorphic curves on noncompact symplectic manifolds with cylindrical ends [OK].

Using the $G$-equivariant Leray--Schauder degree and Burnside ring techniques, we derive computable criteria for the existence of unbounded branches of non-radial solutions and classify their isotropy types. Our approach accommodates non-simple eigenvalue multiplicities and provides explicit bifurcation conditions in terms of spectral resonance between coupling eigenvalues and spherical Laplacian modes. Applications to coupled spherical oscillators illustrate how Platonic symmetries and internal permutations interact to produce complex patterns.

    "abstract": "Since their advent nearly a decade ago, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been studied extensively as a novel technique for solving forward and inverse problems in physics and engineering. The neural network discretization of the solution field is naturally adaptive and avoids meshing the computational domain, which can both improve the accuracy of the numerical solution and streamline implementation. However, there have been limited studies of PINNs on complex three-dimensional geometries, as the lack of mesh and the reliance on the strong form of the partial differential equation (PDE) make boundary condition (BC) enforcement challenging. Techniques to enforce BCs with PINNs have proliferated in the literature, but a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of these techniques and a study of their efficacy on geometrically complex three-dimensional test problems are lacking. In this work, we i) systematically compare BC enforcement techniques for PINNs, ii) propose a general solution framework for arbitrary three-dimensional geometries, and iii) verify the methodology on three-dimensional, linear and nonlinear test problems with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundaries. Our approach is agnostic to the underlying PDE, the geometry of the computational domain, and the nature of the BCs, while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning. This work represents a step in the direction of establishing PINNs as a mature numerical method, capable of competing head-to-head with incumbents such as the finite element method.",

This seems to be the first result on $[0,\u03c4]$ for arbitrary $\u03c4> 0$ for a model coupling moisture dynamics to heat-conducting, compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A key feature of the micro-physics model is that it also includes phase changes of water in moist air. These phase changes are associated with large amounts of latent heat and thus result in a strong coupling to the thermodynamic equation. The well-posedness results are obtained by means of a Lagrangian approach, which allows to treat the hyperbolicity in the continuity equation. More precisely, optimal $\\mathrm{L}^p$-$\\mathrm{L}^q$ estimates are shown for the linearized system, leading to the local well-posedness result by a fixed point argument and suitable nonlinear estimates. For the well-posedness result on $[0,\u03c4]$ for arbitrary $\u03c4> 0$, a refined analysis of the linearized problem close to equilibria is carried out, and the roughness of the source term, induced by the phase changes, requires to establish delicate a priori bounds.",

We consider two common FDTD interface models based on different staggered-grid placements of material parameters. For each, we derive discrete analogs of the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients by formulating effective boundary conditions that emerge from the Yee update equations. A key insight is that the staggered grid implicitly spreads the material discontinuity over a transition layer of one spatial step, leading to systematic deviations from exact theory. We quantify these errors via a transition-layer model and provide (i) qualitative criteria predicting the direction and nature of deviations, and (ii) rigorous error estimates for both weak and strong impedance contrasts. Finally, we examine the role of the Courant number in modulating these errors, revealing conditions under which numerical dispersion and interface discretization jointly influence accuracy.",

    "title": "Consistent Parametric Model Order Reduction by Matrix Interpolation for Varying Underlying Meshes",
    "abstract": "Parametric model order reduction (pMOR) is a powerful tool for accelerating finite element (FE) simulations while maintaining parametric dependencies. For geometric parameters, pMOR by matrix interpolation is a well-suited approach because it does not require an affine representation of the parametric dependency, which is often not available for geometric parameters. However, the method requires that the underlying FE mesh has the same number of degrees of freedom and the same topology for all parameter configurations. This requirement can be difficult or even impossible to achieve for large parameter ranges or when automatic meshing is used. In this work, we propose a novel framework for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes. The key idea is to understand the sampled reduced bases as continuous displacement fields that can be represented in different discretizations. By using mesh morphing and basis interpolation, the sampled reduced bases described in varying meshes can all be represented in terms of one reference mesh. This not only allows for performing pMOR by matrix interpolation, but also enables comparing the subspaces that the reduced bases span, which is important to detect strong changes that could lead to inconsistencies in the reduced operators. For mesh morphing, two strategies, namely morphing by spring analogy with elastic hardening and radial basis function morphing, were implemented and tested. Numerical experiments on a beam-shaped plate and a plate with a hole for one- and two-dimensional parameter spaces show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy for both morphing methods and performs significantly better than two existing approaches for pMOR by matrix interpolation for varying underlying meshes.",

For any Galois conjugate variety $X^\u03c3$ with $\u03c3\\in {\\rm Aut}(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Q})$, we prove the generalized Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture. When $\\varrho$ is furthermore large, we show that the special subsets of $X^\u03c3$ describing the non-hyperbolicity locus coincide, and that this locus is proper exactly when $X$ is of log general type.

    "abstract": "The fluid antenna system (FAS) refers to a family of reconfigurable antenna technologies that provide substantial spatial gains within a compact, predefined small space, thereby offering extensive degrees of freedom in the physical layer for future communication networks. The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is critical, as it determines the placement of ports/antennas, which directly impacts FAS-based optimization. Although various channel estimation methods have been developed, significant flaws persist. For instance, the performance of greedy-based algorithms is heavily influenced by signal assumptions, and current model-free methods are infeasible due to prohibitively high computational complexity issue. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a well-balanced solution that exhibits flexibility, feasibility, and low complexity to support massive connectivity in FAS. In this work, we propose methods based on approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM). The EM-AMP framework uniquely enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning capabilities, independent of prior knowledge of the model or parameters within potential distributions, making it a robust candidate for FAS networks. We introduce two variants of the EM-AMP framework that leverage geographical and angular features in a FAS network. These proposed algorithms demonstrate improved estimation precision, fast convergence, and low computational complexity in large activity regions. Additionally, we analytically elucidate the reasons behind the inherent performance floor of greedy-based methods and highlight the critical role of angular information in algorithm design. Extensive numerical results validate the promising efficacy of the proposed algorithm designs and the derived analytical findings.",

One area of active research is their use in numerical simulation of hyperbolic systems such as the Navier-Stokes equations and the Vlasov equations. One popular time integration scheme is the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), in which the time integration is constrained to a low-rank manifold. However, until recently, DLRA has typically used orthogonal projectors to project the original dynamical system into a reduced space, which is only well-suited for linear systems. DLRA has also mostly been investigated in the context of non-quantized tensor trains. This work investigates interpolative DLRA schemes in which the low-rank manifold is constructed from aptly chosen interpolation points and interpolating polynomials, in the context of QTTs. Through various examples, its performance is compared to its orthogonal counterpart. This work demonstrates how interpolative DLRA is suitable for nonlinear systems and time integrators requiring nonlinear element-wise operations, such as upwind time integration schemes.",

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on constitutive assumptions or homogenization schemes, our method extracts generalized stress--strain data by enforcing non-classical balance laws and compatibility relations on full-field boundary value problems. Specifically, the approach infers the associated generalized stresses and constructs representative material datasets via clustering in a non-classical phase space. We show that the proposed method reliably extracts non-symmetric and higher-order local stress states, providing material data suitable for either model calibration or model-free data-driven simulations of generalized continua. These capabilities are demonstrated in validation simulations with synthetic data and in an application to mechanical metamaterials, suggesting a practical route for material characterization of microstructured solids.",

    "title": "Reducing Pilots in Channel Estimation With Predictive Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is essential for modern wireless systems, which becomes increasingly difficult under large antenna arrays, strict pilot overhead constraints, and diverse deployment environments. Existing artificial intelligence-based solutions often lack robustness and fail to generalize across scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a predictive-foundation-model-based channel estimation framework that enables accurate, low-overhead, and generalizable CSI acquisition. The proposed framework employs a predictive foundation model trained on large-scale cross-domain CSI data to extract universal channel representations and provide predictive priors with strong cross-scenario transferability. A pilot processing network based on a vision transformer architecture is further designed to capture spatial, temporal, and frequency correlations from pilot observations. An efficient fusion mechanism integrates predictive priors with real-time measurements, enabling reliable CSI reconstruction even under sparse or noisy conditions. Extensive evaluations across diverse configurations demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms both classical and data-driven baselines in accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability.",

    "abstract": "We investigate percolation on growing networks where the evolution of connected components resembles a non-equilibrium version of the multiplicative coalescent. The supercritical $\u03c0> \u03c0_c$ regime for a host of such models was conjectured in statistical physics, and then rigorously proven in mathematics, to exhibit behavior similar to the BKT infinite-order phase transition as $\u03c0\\searrow \u03c0_c$. It has further been conjectured that the entire regime $\u03c0<\u03c0_c$ for such growing networks are ''critical'' with power-law cluster size distributions having a non-universal exponent for all values of $\u03c0\\in (0, \u03c0_c)$.\n  In this paper, we study percolation on the uniform attachment model, as a concrete template in order to develop general tools based on stochastic approximation, local convergence, branching random walks and tree-graph inequalities to prove the above conjectured phenomena. For each $\u03c0\\in (0,\u03c0_c)$, we show there exists an explicit $\u03b1(\u03c0) \\in (0,\\tfrac{1}{2}) $ such that the maximal component size, as well as the size of the component containing any fixed vertex, all re-scaled by $n^{\u03b1(\u03c0)}$, converge almost surely to strictly positive random variables as the network size $n \\to \\infty$. These dynamics lead to novel phenomena, compared to classical 'static' models, including long-range dependence and fixation of the identity of the maximal component, within finite time, among a finite number of 'early' components. Moreover, in contrast with most static network models, we show that the susceptibility, that is, the expected size of the component of a uniformly chosen vertex, remains bounded as the network grows and $\u03c0$ approaches $\u03c0_c$ from below. The general tools developed in this paper will be used in follow-up work to understand percolation for general growing network evolution models.",

    "abstract": "In many real world scheduling problems, the processing times of tasks are subject to uncertainty. This makes it essential to design schedules that are robust and able to handle potential disruptions. Therefore, we investigate measures that give us information about the robustness of a schedule. Although many measures can be found in literature, there is no consensus on which measures are the best. We identify 14 robustness measures from the literature, as well as introduce 4 new ones. To find out which of these measures are best used for generating robust schedules, we perform an elaborate simulation study to investigate how well these robustness measures correlate with the stability of the objective function under disturbances (quality robustness) and with the stability of the schedule itself (solution robustness). We first consider the Stochastic Parallel Machine Scheduling Problem (SPMSP) with precedence constraints, which is a very general setting that is relevant for many practical situations. We then perform a second simulation study by taking the best performing measures from the first experiment, and using them for the Train Unit Shunting Problem with Service Scheduling (TUSPwSS). After establishing the correlation with quality and solution robustness, we included the measures as objective in a local search algorithm. We make a comparison between the theoretical setting of the SPMSP and the TUSPwSS, and identify a set of robustness measures that can be applied in many different settings. We show that we can achieve up to 90% decreases in delays compared to using no robustness measures. Lastly, we also identify properties that can be used to predict the effectiveness of such a robustness measure.",

Each step centers every row, normalizes each centered row to unit Euclidean norm, and forms the Gram matrix of the resulting rows. This defines a nonlinear self-map on the space of correlation matrices that underlies classical procedures such as CONCOR and GAP. Despite its long history and simple formulation, the global behavior of this iteration has remained analytically unresolved. We develop a geometric formulation that separates the dynamics into strongly contractive directions associated with row means and norms, and nearly isometric directions tangent to the mean-zero, unit-norm row manifold. This structure explains why local linear convergence results do not extend to a global contraction theorem. Empirically, we conduct a large-scale numerical study over dimensions \\(n\\in[3,2000]\\) and thousands of random initializations using a dimension-uniform experimental framework. Using the Frobenius step size, the entrywise step size, and the one-step contraction ratio, we identify four universal empirical laws that persist uniformly across all tested dimensions: a sharp first-step contraction, quasi-monotone decay with bounded overshoots and finite total variation, a universal relationship between contraction ratio and step size, and convergence in a uniformly bounded number of iterations. These findings provide the first quantitative, dimension-uniform description of the iteration and establish a precise benchmark for future global analysis.",

Gray and Ru\u0161kuc (2024) gave the first example of a finitely presented SIM whose submonoid of right units does not admit a decomposition into a free product of the group of units and a finite rank free monoid. In the first part of this paper we prove a general result which shows that the only instances where the right units of a finitely presented SIM can admit such a free product decomposition is when their group of units is finitely presented. In showing this, we establish some general results about finite generation and presentability of subgroups of SIMs. In particular, we give an exact characterisation of when an arbitrary subgroup is finitely generated in terms of connectedness properties of unions of its cosets in its $\\mathscr{R}$-class, and also a characterisation of when an arbitrary subgroup is finitely presented. We also give a sufficient condition for finite generation and presentability of an arbitrary subgroup given in terms of a geometric finiteness property called boundary width. As a consequence, we show that the classes of monoids of right units of finitely presented SIMs and prefix monoids of finitely presented groups are independent. In the second part of the paper, we show that every finitely generated submonoid of a finitely RC-presented monoid is isomorphic to a submonoid $N$ of a finitely presented SIM $M$ such that $N$ is a submonoid of the right units of $M$, and $N$ contains the group of units of $M$. This result generalises and extends the classification of groups of units of finitely presented SIMs recently obtained by Gray and Kambites (2025). From this, we derive a number of surprising properties of RC-presentations for right cancellative monoids contrasting the classical theory of monoid presentations.",

For the Poisson stick model, the critical intensities at which these transitions occur will depend on $L$, and in this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of these critical points as $L\\to \\infty.$ Our main results show that the critical point for the percolation phase transition scales like $L^{-2},$ while the critical point for the uniqueness phase transition scales like $L^{-1}.$ Comparing these results to the analogous results in Euclidean space show that the behavior of the percolation phase transition is the same in these two settings, while the uniqueness phase transition scales differently.",

    "abstract": "This article aims to provide an accessible, tutorial-style introduction to hybrid extremum-seeking systems, which are model-free, feedback-optimization controllers that incorporate hybrid dynamics, meaning both continuous-time and discrete-time behaviors. Such systems arise when advanced control and optimization tools are needed to overcome the limitations of smooth feedback methods and to satisfy demanding transient and steady-state requirements in high-performance applications. They also appear when controllers must operate on plants that inherently exhibit hybrid behaviors, as is common in cyber-physical and autonomous systems that rely on digital sensing, computation, and actuation. To study hybrid extremum-seeking dynamics through control-theoretic methods, we first review the key concepts that support the development of perturbation theory for hybrid inclusions, forming the basis for averaging and singular perturbation analyses. We then show how these ideas apply to the design and evaluation of hybrid extremum-seeking algorithms for static and dynamic plants. Several examples are presented, including set-valued and switching algorithms under different switching regimes such as arbitrarily fast switching, dwell-time and average dwell-time constraints, and average activation time conditions. We also discuss state-based switching extremum seeking for obstacle-avoidance problems and gradient-Newton switching schemes. Additional topics include momentum-based and reset-type extremum seeking, intermittent updates, slowly varying parameters, hybrid filters, and safety-aware schemes that incorporate constraints. Across all these settings, we illustrate how perturbation-based methods traditionally used for extremum-seeking control naturally extend to hybrid systems when mild regularity assumptions are satisfied, and solutions are modeled on hybrid time domains.",

Under constant material parameters, the Maxwell system is reduced to a vector wave equation for the electric field, which we discretize globally in space and time using a staggered spectral collocation scheme. The staggered polynomial spaces are designed so that the discrete curl and divergence operators preserve the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. The magnetic field is then recovered in a space--time post-processing step via a discrete version of Faraday's law. The global space--time formulation yields a large but highly structured linear system, which we approximate in low-rank TT-format directly from the operator and data, without assuming that the forcing is separable in space and time. We derive condition-number bounds for the resulting operator and prove spectral convergence estimates for both the electric and magnetic fields. Numerical experiments for three-dimensional electromagnetic test problems confirm the theoretical convergence rates and show that the TT-based solver maintains accuracy with approximately linear complexity in the number of grid points in space and time.",

It is known, by a result of Diestel, Halin, and Vogler, that the class of countable rayless graphs does not admit a countable universal family, leaving open the precise complexity of this class. We prove that for every infinite cardinal $\u03ba$, the class of rayless graphs of cardinality at most $\u03ba$ admits a strongly universal family of size exactly $\u03ba^+$, and that no smaller family can exist. This settles the problem for the countable case and extends uniformly to higher cardinalities.\n  We further investigate subclasses defined by forbidding subgraphs. When finitely many finite graphs are forbidden, the strong complexity remains $\u03ba^+$, except in degenerate cases where it collapses to countable. In contrast, the class of countable rayless graphs when forbidding certain infinite graphs has a complexity that reaches its maximum possible value, the continuum.\n  Finally, we establish that natural subclasses -- including rayless trees, bipartite rayless graphs, graphs without even cycles, and graphs without infinite trails -- retain the minimal strong complexity $\u03ba^+$. These results provide a comprehensive characterization of universality in rayless graphs and highlight both its stability under restrictions and its sensitivity to specific obstructions.",

The main ingredient is a new factorization result for locally equidimensional morphisms of schemes, which is of independent interest. Additionally, we prove a weak Boutot-type theorem for $F$-rationality, which says that $F$-rationality descends under pure ring maps that are locally equidimensional under universally catenary assumptions.

As $n$ becomes large, the asymptotic behavior of $N_n(k)$ depends of course on the structure of the tree. Motivated by the study of the edge density in the Brownian co-graphon, Chapuy recently considered this problem in the case where $k=2$ and where the tree is the Brownian continuum random tree. We vastly extend this framework by considering general values of $k$ and general fragmentation trees, which include some prominent examples such as stable L\u00e9vy trees and idealized models of phylogenetic trees. Other natural ancestral statistics are also considered. For a given tree model, we identify a phase transition-like phenomenon, with different asymptotic regimes for $N_k(n)$, depending on the position of $k$ relative to a model-dependent critical value.",

We show that our model behaves consistently under standard local moves of the dimer model. On the geometric side, this gives rise to a new class of theorems in linear incidence geometry - dynamical incidence theorems. Examples include results on pentagram maps, pentagram spirals, and Q-nets. We also examine the problem of parametrizing coherent double circuit configurations. In particular, we study whether, once the white-vertex part of the data is fixed, one can recover the black-vertex data from a point on the spectral curve.",

Robustness involves temporarily inflating prior estimates of noise covariances, while adaptivity updates prior beliefs using real-time information. In practical applications, both process and measurement noise can be influenced by outliers, be time-varying, or both. Existing works may not effectively address the above complex noise scenarios, as there is an intrinsic incompatibility between robust filters and adaptive filters. In this work, we propose a unified variational robust Kalman filter, built on a Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, and solved through fixed-point iteration in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate that robustness can be understood as a prerequisite for adaptivity, making it possible to merge the above two competing goals into a single framework through switching rules. Additionally, our proposed filter can recover conventional KF, robust KF, and adaptive KF by adjusting parameters, and can suppress both the imperfect process and measurement noise, enabling it to perform superiorly in complex noise environments. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The main aim of this paper is to obtain Bochkarev-type inequalities for the anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces. In the classical setting, Bochkarev obtained inequalities of the Hardy--Littlewood type, which reveal the connection between the integral properties of functions and the summability of their Fourier coefficients. His results describe the behavior of trigonometric series in the Lorentz spaces $L_{2,r}$ for $2 < r \\le \\infty$. In this work, we extend these ideas to the framework of anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces. Using an approach based on the extrapolation of linear operators, we derive new Bochkarev-type inequalities that generalize the classical results to the case of anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces and arbitrary orthonormal systems. We investigate the summability properties of the Fourier coefficients of functions from anisotropic grand Lorentz spaces.",

    "abstract": "Channel charting creates a low-dimensional representation of the radio environment in a self-supervised manner using manifold learning. Preserving relative spatial distances in the latent space, channel charting is well suited to support user localization. While prior work on channel charting has mainly focused on two-dimensional scenarios, real-world environments are inherently three-dimensional. In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting. For the second scenario, we introduce multistory channel charting, a two-stage approach consisting of floor classification via clustering followed by the training of a dedicated expert neural network for channel charting on each individual floor, thereby enhancing the channel charting performance. In addition, we propose a novel feature engineering method designed to extract sparse features from the beamspace channel state information that are suitable for localization.",

As a model on the detailed scale, we start from a parabolic relaxation of the Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system. We consider a sequence of initial data where the sequence of initial densities is assumed to be highly oscillating mimicking the high number of phase boundaries initially. Then, we consider a sequence of finite energy weak solutions corresponding to the sequence of initial data. Anticipating that the effective equations are found in the limit of infinitely many initial phase changes, we interpret the densities as Young measures and prove the convergence of the sequence of solutions to the effective model. The effective model consists of a deterministic part for the fluid's hydrodynamic quantities and a kinetic equation for the limit Young measure encoding the mixing dynamics. By characterizing the Young measure with the corresponding cumulative distribution function, we rewrite the kinetic equation for the Young measure into a kinetic equation for the cumulative distribution function such that the resulting equations are accessible by standard approximation methods.",

In particular, if $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} a_{k+1}/a_k = \u03b7> 1$ for some transcendental number $\u03b7$, we prove that for every $m\\in \\mathbb N$ the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ is asymptotically equivalent to the $m$-th cumulant of the ``independent model'' $\\widetilde{S}_n := \\sum_{k=1}^n \\cos (2 \u03c0a_k U_k)$, where $U_1, U_2, \\dots$ are independent random variables having uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. In particular, the order of growth of the cumulants as $n \\to \\infty$ is linear in this case. We also show that the transcendence condition for $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} a_{k+1}/a_k$ is in general necessary: when the ratio limit $\u03b7$ is algebraic, the cumulants of $S_n$ may have a different asymptotic order from those of $\\widetilde{S}_n$. For instance, for $a_k = 2^k+1$ (with $\u03b7= 2$), the sixth cumulant of $S_n$ grows quadratically in $n$. In contrast, for $a_k = 2^k$ (again $\u03b7= 2$) or when $(a_k)_{k \\geq 1}$ is the Fibonacci sequence (with $\u03b7= (1+\\sqrt 5)/2$), the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ grows linearly as $n\\to\\infty$, but with a growth rate that differs from the one of the independent model $\\widetilde{S}_n$. Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way. This is particularly remarkable since many other probabilistic limit theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem, hold for lacunary trigonometric sums in a universal way without any such sensitivity towards arithmetic effects.",

However, it is impossible to decide in terms of the regularity of the given boundary function when a classical solution exists.

Deterministic methods can produce accurate solutions without any statistical noise, yet often at a price of expensive computational costs originating from the intrinsic high dimensionality of the model. With this work, we present the first systematic investigation of projection-based reduced order models (ROMs) following the reduced basis method (RBM) framework to simulate the parametric steady-state RTE with isotropic scattering and one energy group. Four ROMs are designed, with each defining a nested family of reduced surrogate solvers of different resolution/fidelity. They are based on either a Galerkin or least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection and utilize either an $L_1$ or residual-based importance/error indicator. Two of the proposed ROMs are certified in the setting when the absorption cross section is positively bounded below uniformly. One technical focus and contribution lie in the proposed implementation strategies under the affine assumption of the parameter dependence of the model. These well-crafted broadly applicable strategies not only ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the offline training stage and the online prediction of reduced surrogate solvers, they also take into account the conditioning of the reduced systems as well as the stagnation-free residual evaluation for numerical robustness. Computational complexities are derived for both the offline training and online prediction stages of the proposed model order reduction strategies, and they are demonstrated numerically along with the accuracy and robustness of the reduced surrogate solvers. Numerically we observe four to six orders of magnitude speedup of our ROMs compared to full order models for some 2D2v examples.",

    "abstract": "In the frequency domain wave scattering problems, obstacles can be effectively replaced by point scatterers as soon as the wavelength of the incident wave exceeds significantly their diameter. The situation is less clear in the time domain, where recent works suggest the presence of an additional temporal scale that quantifies the smallness of the obstacle. In this paper we argue that this is not necessarily the case, and that it is possible to construct asymptotic models with an error that does not deteriorate in time, at least in the case of a sound-soft scattering problem by a star-shaped obstacle in 3D.",

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful strategy for constrained multivariable systems but faces computational challenges in real-time deployment due to its online optimization requirements. While explicit MPC and neural network approximations mitigate this burden, they suffer from scalability issues or lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in safety-critical systems. This work introduces a data-driven framework that directly learns the Linear MPC control law from sampled state-action pairs using Oblique Decision Trees with Linear Predictions (ODT-LP), achieving both computational efficiency and interpretability. By leveraging the piecewise affine structure of Linear MPC, we prove that the Linear MPC control law can be replicated by finite-depth ODT-LP models. We develop a gradient-based training algorithm using smooth approximations of tree routing functions to learn this structure from grid-sampled Linear MPC solutions, enabling end-to-end optimization. Input-to-state stability is established under bounded approximation errors, with explicit error decomposition into learning inaccuracies and sampling errors to inform model design. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ODT-LP controllers match MPC's closed-loop performance while reducing online evaluation time by orders of magnitude compared to MPC, explicit MPC, neural network, and random forest counterparts. The transparent tree structure enables formal verification of control logic, bridging the gap between computational efficiency and certifiable reliability for safety-critical systems.",

Our main tools and results, which are of independent interest, establish that Cartesian powers enjoy Ramsey-type properties for graphs with favorable Tur\u00e1n-type characteristics, such as zero hypercube Tur\u00e1n density.\n  In addition, we prove induced variants of these results, find bounds on $\u03c7_H(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ for growing dimensions $n$, and prove a canonical-type result. We conclude with many open problems. One of these is to determine $\u03c7_{C_4}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, for a cycle $C_4$ on four vertices.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an anti-interference affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) system to ensure reliability and resource efficiency under malicious high-power interference originating from adversarial devices in high-mobility scenarios. Closed-form expressions of interferences in the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain are derived by utilizing the stationary phase principle and the Affine Fourier transform convolution theorem, which indicates that interference impacts can be classified into stationary and non-stationary categories. On this basis, we reveal the analytical relationship between packet throughput and the paramerters of spread spectrum and error correction coding in our proposed anti-interference system, which enables the design of a parameter optimization algorithm that maximizes packet throughput. For reception, by jointly utilizing the autocorrelation function of spreading sequence and the cyclic-shift property of AFDM input-output relation, we design a linear-complexity correlation-based DAFT domain detector (CDD) capable of achieving full diversity gain, which performs correlation-based equalization to avoid matrix inversion. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and verify that the proposed anti-interference AFDM system could achieve high packet throughput under interference in high-mobility scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Designing controllers under uncertainty requires balancing the need to explore system dynamics with the requirement to maintain reliable control performance. Dual control addresses this challenge by selecting actions that both regulate the system and actively gather informative data. This paper investigates the use of the Active Inference framework, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, for developing a dual model-predictive controller (MPC). To identify and quantify uncertainty, we introduce an online sparse semi-parametric Gaussian Process model that combines the flexibility of nonparametric with the efficiency of parametric learning for real-time updates. By applying the expected free energy functional to this adaptive probabilistic model, we derive an MPC objective that incorporates an information-theoretic term, which captures uncertainty arising from both the learned model and measurement noise. This formulation leads to a stochastic optimal control problem for dual controller design, which is solved using a novel dynamic-programming-based method. Simulation results on a vehicle use case demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enhances autonomous driving control performance across different settings and scenarios.",

An adaptive scheme is proposed to pinpoint the relevant scenarios in a discretized uncertainty space; these scenarios are then fed into a multi-objective adjustable robust optimization framework reducing the computational burden compared to the consideration of all potential scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a method to quantify the cost or price of robustness, i.e., the compromise which has to be made in comparison to the nominal design case in order to hedge against uncertainty.

After carefully studying the well posedness of the model, we introduce a suitable discretization and perform an extensive range of numerical experiments to assess the impact of different modeling ingredients. The dynamical system is capable of recovering the order-disorder phase transition of the flock, as well as the jamming effect in high density regimes.
