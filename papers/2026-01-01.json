Furthermore, we characterize total quotient rings and strongly zero-dimensional rings in terms of strongly multiplicative sets. We also answer an open question by Hamed and Malek about whether this condition is needed for S-minimal primes to exist. In addition, we prove a Strong Krull's Separation Lemma, which guarantees a maximal ideal disjoint from S. Finally, we demonstrate that if S is a strongly multiplicative set and S is not contained in U(R), then S-minimal primes are not classical prime ideals, and we provide an algorithmic approach to constructing such ideals.",

We prove that small-step RRR is a forward-Euler discretization of this flow, so that solution times measured in rescaled units converge to a finite limit while iteration counts diverge, explaining the emergence of iteration-optimal relaxation parameters.

Algorithmically, this procedure is an iterative greedy approach, where the greedy objective is evaluated through an error estimator that exploits the linearity of the frequency domain representation. The greedy framework is motivated through theoretical results of rational approximability of functions. This framework provides a principled approach to rational compression of high-order rational functions, and provides a computational pathway for model reduction of parametric LTI systems.",

The latter, in particular, represents a preliminary step in view of a full 3D numerical relativity calculation on moving meshes. Both schemes are equipped with a well-balancing (WB) property, which allows to preserve the equilibrium of a priori known stationary solutions exactly at the discrete level. We validate our numerical approaches by successfully reproducing standard vacuum test cases, such as the robust stability, the linearized wave, and the gauge wave tests, as well as achieving long-term stable evolutions of stationary black holes, including Kerr black holes with extreme spin. Concerning the coupling with matter, modeled by the relativistic Euler equations, we perform a classical test of spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, as well as an evolution of a perturbed non-rotating neutron star, demonstrating the capability of our schemes to operate also on the full Einstein-Euler system. Altogether, these results provide a solid foundation for addressing more complex and challenging simulations of astrophysical sources through DG schemes on unstructured 3D meshes.",

    "abstract": "The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in modern data centers demands a radical transformation of interconnect architectures. Traditional copper and optical wiring face fundamental challenges in latency, power consumption, and rigidity, constraining the scalability of distributed AI clusters. This article introduces a vision for Terahertz (THz) Wireless Data Center (THz-WDC) that combines ultra-broadband capacity, one-hop low-latency communication, and energy efficiency in the short-to-medium range (1-100m). Performance and technical requirements are first articulated, including up to 1 Tbps per link, aggregate throughput up to 10 Tbps via spatial multiplexing, sub-50 ns single-hop latency, and sub-10 pJ/bit energy efficiency over 20m. To achieve these ambitious goals, key enabling technologies are explored, including digital-twin-based orchestration, low-complexity beam manipulation technologies, all-silicon THz transceivers, and low-complexity analog baseband architectures. Moreover, as future data centers shift toward quantum and chiplet-based modular architectures, THz wireless links provide a flexible mechanism for interconnecting, testing, and reconfiguring these modules. Finally, numerical analysis is presented on the latency and power regimes of THz versus optical and copper interconnects, identifying the specific distance and throughput domains where THz links can surpass conventional wired solutions. The article concludes with a roadmap toward wireless-defined, reconfigurable, and sustainable AI data centers.",

Existing sample complexity analysis for policy mirror descent either focuses on the generative sampling model, or the Markovian sampling model but with the action values being explicitly approximated to certain pre-specified accuracy. In contrast, we consider the sample complexity of policy mirror descent with temporal difference (TD) learning under the Markovian sampling model. Two algorithms called Expected TD-PMD and Approximate TD-PMD have been presented, which are off-policy and mixed policy algorithms respectively. Under a small enough constant policy update step size, the $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ (a logarithm factor about $\\varepsilon$ is hidden in $\\tilde{O}(\\cdot)$) sample complexity can be established for them to achieve average-time $\\varepsilon$-optimality.

Furthermore, we investigate a modular analogue, formulated using dimension subgroups over a field of positive characteristic instead of lower central series. To prove the main results, we establish general criteria that guarantee equivalences between the categories of polynomial functors of different degrees or with different base categories. They are described by using a two-sided ideal of a monad associated with the base category, which encodes polynomiality of a specific degree.

In particular, extremal questions of maximizing and minimizing $\\hom(G,H)$ have been considered when $H$ is a clique or $G$ is a tree.\n  In this paper, we develop a new technique using automorphisms of $H$ to show that $\\hom(T,H)$ is minimized by paths as $T$ varies over trees on a fixed number of vertices. We introduce the term Hoffman-London to refer to graphs that are minimal in this sense. In particular, we define an automorphic similarity matrix which is used to compute $\\hom(T,H)$ and give matrix conditions under which $H$ is Hoffman-London.\n  We then apply this technique to identify several families of graphs that are Hoffman-London, including loop threshold graphs and some with applications in statistical physics (e.g. the Widom-Rowlinson model). By combining our approach with a few other observations, we fully characterize the minimizing trees for all graphs $H$ on three or fewer vertices.",

When the input curve is real, we prove that every complex liftable member of a given tropical tritangent class either completely lifts to the reals or none of its liftings are defined over the reals.

We derive qualitative local stability estimates in region-wise maximum norms that govern the size of each bump's essential support, confining its core to a designated region and minimizing overlap.

The purpose of examining this class is that it differs significantly from the commonly discussed spin system on the integer lattice with nearest-neighbour interactions. After introducing general results on the partition function and covariance for the class of Gaussian free fields, we present detailed properties of some specific models. Group-theoretic arguments and the Fourier transform give some explicit results.",

    "title": "Tensor-Network Analysis of Root Patterns in the XXX Model with Open Boundaries",
    "abstract": "The string hypothesis for Bethe roots represents a cornerstone in the study of quantum integrable systems, providing access to physical quantities such as the ground-state energy and the finite-temperature free energy. While the $t-W$ scheme and the inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation have enabled significant methodological advances for systems with broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the underlying physics induced by symmetry breaking remains largely unexplored, due to the previously unknown distributions of the transfer-matrix roots. In this paper, we propose a new approach to determining the patterns of zero roots and Bethe roots for the $\u039b-\u03b8$ and inhomogeneous Bethe ansatz equations using tensor-network algorithms. As an explicit example, we consider the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain with non-diagonal boundary conditions. The exact structures of both zero roots and Bethe roots are obtained in the ground state for large system sizes, up to ($N\\simeq 60$ and $100$). We find that even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry, the Bethe and zero roots still exhibit a highly structured pattern. The zero roots organize into bulk strings, boundary strings, and additional roots, forming two dominant lines with boundary-string attachments. Correspondingly, the Bethe roots can be classified into four distinct types: regular roots, line roots, arc roots, and paired-line roots. These structures are associated with a real-axis line, a vertical line, characteristic arcs in the complex plane, and boundary-induced conjugate pairs. Comparative analysis reveals that the $t-W$ scheme generates significantly simpler root topologies than those obtained via off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz.",

It depends on availability of (approximate) Stein score functions for various levels of additive noise. We describe and analyze a modular scheme that reduces score-based sampling to solving a short sequence of ``nice'' sampling problems, for which high-accuracy samplers are known. We show how to design forward trajectories such that both (a) the terminal distribution, and (b) each of the backward conditional distribution is defined by a strongly log concave (SLC) distribution. This modular reduction allows us to exploit \\emph{any} SLC sampling algorithm in order to traverse the backwards path, and we establish novel guarantees with short proofs for both uni-modal and multi-modal densities. The use of high-accuracy routines yields $\\varepsilon$-accurate answers, in either KL or Wasserstein distances, with polynomial dependence on $\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$ and $\\sqrt{d}$ dependence on the dimension.",

Under different variable-node edge-spreading rules, the random Tanner graphs of several coupled ensembles are defined by multiple independent, uniformly random monomial maps. The two main coupled ensembles considered are referred to as the standard coupled ensemble and the improved coupled ensemble. We prove that both coupled ensembles exhibit asymptotically good minimum distance and minimum stopping set size. Theoretical and numerical results show that the improved coupled ensemble can achieve better distance performance than the standard coupled ensemble. We introduce the essential preliminaries and analytical tools needed to analyze the iterative decoding threshold of coupled ensembles over any finite field. We consider a class of memoryless channels with special symmetry, termed q-ary input memoryless symmetric channels (QMSCs), and show that, for these channels, the distribution of channel messages (in form of probability vectors) likewise exhibits this symmetry. Consequently, we define symmetric probability measures and their reference measures on a finite-dimensional probability simplex, analyze their foundational properties and those of their linear functionals, endow their respective spaces with metric topologies, and conduct an in-depth study of their degradation theory. Based on our analytical framework, we establish a universal threshold saturation result for both of the coupled ensembles over a q-ary finite field on QMSCs. Specifically, as the coupling parameters increase, the belief-propagation threshold of a coupled system saturates to a well-defined threshold that depends only on the underlying ensemble and the channel family.",

This notion yields a clean stability certificate: we establish a unified lower bound over both real and complex fields, and in the real case also an upper bound, each in terms of the reciprocal kernel Cheeger constant. Our framework treats finite- and infinite-dimensional settings uniformly and covers discrete, semi-discrete, and continuous measurement domains. For generalized wavelet phase retrieval from (semi-)discrete frames, we bound the kernel Cheeger constant by the Cheeger constant of a data-dependent weighted graph.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a Chebyshev polynomial expansion framework for the recovery of a continuous angular power spectrum (APS) from channel covariance. By exploiting the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials in a transformed domain, we derive an exact series representation of the covariance and reformulate the inherently ill-posed APS inversion as a finite-dimensional linear regression problem via truncation. The associated approximation error is directly controlled by the tail of the APS's Chebyshev series and decays rapidly with increasing angular smoothness. Building on this representation, we derive an exact semidefinite characterization of nonnegative APS and introduce a derivative-based regularizer that promotes smoothly varying APS profiles while preserving transitions of clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed Chebyshev-based framework yields accurate APS reconstruction, and enables reliable downlink (DL) covariance prediction from uplink (UL) measurements in a frequency division duplex (FDD) setting. These findings indicate that jointly exploiting smoothness and nonnegativity in a Chebyshev domain provides an effective tool for covariance-domain processing in multi-antenna systems.",

In this note, we present three new results concerning this group. First, in two dimensions, we provide a complete characterization of the weight parameters that yield a finite group. In higher dimensions, we show that whenever the group is finite, it must necessarily be isomorphic to a simpler reflection group. Finally, in dimension three, we give a full classification of the parameters leading to a finite group that also satisfies an additional Weyl property.",

In particular, starting with Reed-Solomon codes of dimension $k=2$ yields hierarchical quasi-cyclic codes with Tanner graphs of girth 6.\n  We present a table of small code parameters and note that some of these codes meet the best known minimum distance for binary codes, with the additional hierarchical quasi-cyclic structure.

By exploiting the sparsity inherent in generalized polynomial chaos expansions, we derive hierarchical preconditioners based on truncated stochastic expansion that strike an effective balance between computational cost and preconditioning quality.

    "abstract": "This paper aims at developing exactly energy-conservative and structure-preserving finite volume schemes for the discretisation of first-order symmetric-hyperbolic and thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) systems of partial differential equations in continuum physics. Due to their thermodynamic compatibility the class of SHTC systems satisfies an additional conservation law for the total energy and many PDE in this class of equations also satisfy stationary differential constraints (involutions). First, we propose a simple semi-discrete cell-centered HTC finite volume scheme that employs collocated grids and that is compatible with the total energy conservation law, but which does not satisfy the involutions. Second, we develop a fully discrete semi-implicit finite volume scheme that conserves total energy and which can be proven to satisfy also the involution constraints exactly at the discrete level. This method is a vertex-based staggered semi-implicit scheme that preserves the basic vector calculus identities $\\nabla \\cdot \\nabla \\times A = 0$ and $\\nabla \\times \\nabla \u03c6= 0$ for any vector and scalar field, respectively, exactly at the discrete level and which is also exactly totally energy conservative. The main key ingredient of the proposed implicit scheme is the fact that it uses a discrete version of the symmetric-hyperbolic Godunov-form of the governing PDE system. This leads naturally to sequences of symmetric and positive definite linear algebraic systems to be solved inside an iterative fixed-point method used in each time step. We apply our new schemes to three different SHTC systems. In particular, we consider the equations of nonlinear acoustics, the nonlinear Maxwell equations in the absence of charges and a nonlinear version of the Maxwell-GLM system. We also show some numerical results to provide evidence of the stated properties of the proposed schemes.",

We associate a filtered cospan to a Morse function $f:X\\to [-\u039b,\u039b]$ such that $\\partial X$ is the union of the regular level sets $f^{-1}(\\{\\pm\u039b\\})$; this allows us to capture the interlevel persistence of such a function in terms of data associated to Morse chain complexes. Similar filtered cospans are associated to simplicial and singular chain complexes, and isomorphism theorems are proven relating these to each other and to relative interlevel set homology. Filtered cospans can be decomposed, under modest hypotheses, into certain standard elementary summands, giving rise to a notion of persistence diagram for filtered cospans that is amenable to computation. An isometry theorem connects interleavings of filtered cospans to matchings between these persistence diagrams.",

    "abstract": "A sign pattern is a matrix that has entries from the set $\\{+,-,0\\}$. An $n\\times n$ sign pattern $\\mathcal{P}$ is called consistent if every real matrix in its qualitative class has exactly $k$ real eigenvalues and $n-k$ nonreal eigenvalues for some integer $k$, with $1\\leq k\\leq n$. In the article \\cite{1}, the authors established a necessary condition for irreducible, tridiagonal patterns with a $0$-diagonal to be consistent. Subsequently, they proposed that this condition is also sufficient for such patterns to be consistent. In this article, we first demonstrate that this proposition does not hold. We characterize all irreducible, tridiagonal sign patterns with a $0$-diagonal of order at most five that are consistent. Moreover, we establish useful, necessary conditions for irreducible, combinatorially symmetric sign patterns to be consistent. Finally, we introduce the class $\u0394$ of all $2$-consistent sign patterns and provide several necessary conditions for sign patterns to belong to this class.",

    "title": "Efficient Decoding of Twisted GRS Codes and Roth--Lempel Codes",
    "abstract": "MDS codes play a central role in practice due to their broad applications. To date, most known MDS codes are generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes, leaving codes that are not equivalent to GRS codes comparatively less understood. Studying this non-GRS regime is therefore of intrinsic theoretical interest, and is also practically relevant since the strong algebraic structure of GRS codes can be undesirable in cryptographic settings. Among the known non-GRS codes, twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes and Roth-Lempel codes are two representative families of non-GRS codes that have attracted significant attention. Though substantial work has been devoted to the construction and structural analysis of TGRS and Roth-Lempel codes, comparatively little attention has been paid to their decoding, and many problems remain open. In this paper, we propose list and unique decoding algorithms for TGRS codes and Roth-Lempel codes based on the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm. Under suitable parameter conditions, our algorithms achieve near-linear running time in the code length, improving upon the previously best-known quadratic-time complexity. Our TGRS decoder supports fixed-rate TGRS codes with up to O(n^2) twists, substantially extending prior work that only handled the single-twist case. For Roth-Lempel codes, we provide what appears to be the first efficient decoder. Moreover, our list decoders surpass the classical unique-decoding radius for a broad range of parameters. Finally, we incorporate algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) codes into the list-decoding framework, enabling recovery of the correct message from the output list with high probability.",

    "title": "Random Multiplexing",
    "abstract": "As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.",

We give sufficient criteria that guarantee the integrability for the aforementioned generalized structures, formulated in terms of properties of the associated $2$-form and connection.

    "abstract": "We develop and analyze a single-loop algorithm for minimizing the sum of a Lipschitz differentiable function $f$, a prox-friendly proper closed function $g$ (with a closed domain on which $g$ is continuous) and the composition of another prox-friendly proper closed function $h$ (whose domain is closed on which $h$ is continuous) with a continuously differentiable mapping $c$ (that is Lipschitz continuous and Lipschitz differentiable on the convex closure of the domain of $g$). Such models arise naturally in many contemporary applications, where $f$ is the loss function for data misfit, and $g$ and $h$ are nonsmooth functions for inducing desirable structures in $x$ and $c(x)$. Existing single-loop algorithms mainly focus either on the case where $h$ is Lipschitz continuous or the case where $h$ is an indicator function of a closed convex set. In this paper, we develop a single-loop algorithm for more general possibly non-Lipschitz $h$. Our algorithm is a single-loop variant of the successive difference-of-convex approximation method (SDCAM) proposed in [22]. We show that when $h$ is Lipschitz, our algorithm exhibits an iteration complexity that matches the best known complexity result for obtaining an $(\u03b5_1,\u03b5_2,0)$-stationary point. Moreover, we show that, by assuming additionally that dom $g$ is compact, our algorithm exhibits an iteration complexity of $\\tilde{O}(\u03b5^{-4})$ for obtaining an $(\u03b5,\u03b5,\u03b5)$-stationary point when $h$ is merely continuous and real-valued. Furthermore, we consider a scenario where $h$ does not have full domain and establish vanishing bounds on successive changes of iterates. Finally, in all three cases mentioned above, we show that one can construct a subsequence such that any accumulation point $x^*$ satisfies $c(x^*)\\in$ dom $h$, and if a standard constraint qualification holds at $x^*$, then $x^*$ is a stationary point.",

Very recently, Huang et al. (IEEE Trans. Inform.

There, a convergence rate of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{h})$ in the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance was obtained for the Euler discretization with a uniform time step-size $h>0$.\n  By incorporating a temperature parameter, different samplers are introduced in this paper, based on the Euler discretization of the Schr\u00f6dinger-F\u00f6llmer process with temperatures. As revealed by numerical experiments, high temperatures are vital, particularly in sampling from multimodal distributions. Further, a novel approach of error analysis is developed for the time discretization and an enhanced convergence rate of order ${ \\mathcal{O}(h)}$ is obtained in the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance, under certain smoothness conditions on the drift. This significantly improves the existing order-half convergence in the aforementioned paper. Unlike Langevin samplers, SFS is of gradient-free, works in a unit interval $[0, 1]$ and does not require any ergodicity. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence rate and show that, the SFS substantially outperforms vanilla Langevin samplers, particularly in sampling from multimodal distributions.",

Indeed, for each $k\\ge2$ and $m>m_0(k)$, we establish asymptotically tight lower and upper bounds on the over-thresholds (provided they exist) and show that for infinitely many instances of $m$ the two bounds coincide.

They have also recently become key to modern machine learning methods, e.g., for plug-and-play methods for learned denoisers and deep neural architectures for learning priors of proximal operators. The latter was developed partly due to recent work characterizing proximal operators of nonconvex priors as subdifferential of convex potentials. In this work, we propose to leverage connections between proximal operators and Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations (HJ PDEs) to develop novel deep learning architectures for learning the prior. In contrast to other existing methods, we learn the prior directly without recourse to inverting the prior after training. We present several numerical results that demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in high dimensions.",

Yang reshaped modern physics through the introduction of non-abelian gauge theory and, independently, through the consistency conditions underlying what is now called the Yang-Baxter equation. Baxter transformed those conditions into a systematic theory of exact solvability in statistical mechanics and quantum integrable systems. This article is written in memory of Baxter and Yang, whose work revealed how local consistency principles generate global mathematical structure. We review the Yang-Mills formulation of gauge theory, its mass obstruction and resolution via symmetry breaking, and the geometric framework it engendered, including instantons, Donaldson-Floer theory, magnetic monopoles, and Hitchin systems. In parallel, we trace the emergence of the Yang-Baxter equation from factorised scattering to solvable lattice models, quantum groups, and Chern-Simons theory. Rather than separate narratives, gauge theory and integrability are presented as complementary manifestations of a shared coherence principle, an ongoing journey from gauge symmetry toward mathematical unity.",

Second, using surface models, we characterize silting-discreteness for the perfect derived categories of graded gentle and skew-gentle algebras. Specifically, for a graded gentle algebra, silting-discreteness is equivalent to its associated surface being of genus zero with non-zero winding numbers for all simple closed curves.

The running time is exponential in $m$, and becomes pseudo-polynomial if $m$ is a constant. In recent years, there has been extensive research on FPT (fixed parameter tractable) algorithms for the so-called $n$-fold IPs, which may possess a large number of constraints, but the constraint matrix satisfies a specific block structure. It is remarkable that these FPT algorithms take as parameters $\u0394$ and the number of rows and columns of some small submatrices. If $\u0394$ is not treated as a parameter, then the running time becomes pseudo-polynomial even if all the other parameters are taken as constants.\n  This paper explores the trade-off between time and accuracy in solving an IP. We show that, for arbitrary small $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists an algorithm for IPs with $m$ constraints that runs in ${f(m,\\varepsilon)}\\cdot\\textnormal{poly}(|I|)$ time, and returns a near-feasible solution that violates the constraints by at most $\\varepsilon\u0394$. Furthermore, for $n$-fold IPs, we establish a similar result -- our algorithm runs in time that depends on the number of rows and columns of small submatrices together with $1/\\varepsilon$, and returns a solution that slightly violates the constraints. Meanwhile, both solutions guarantee that their objective values are no worse than the corresponding optimal objective values satisfying the constraints. As applications, our results can be used to obtain additive approximation schemes for multidimensional knapsack as well as scheduling.",

Building on this foundation, we propose a single-index bandit algorithm and establish its convergence rate. We further derive a matching lower bound, showing that the algorithm achieves minimax-optimal regret independent of the ambient dimension $d$, thereby overcoming the curse of dimensionality.\n  We also establish an impossibility result for adaptation: without additional assumptions, no policy can adapt to unknown smoothness levels. Under a standard self-similarity condition, however, we construct a policy that remains minimax-optimal while automatically adapting to the unknown smoothness. Finally, as the dimension $d$ increases, our algorithm continues to achieve minimax-optimal regret, revealing a phase transition that characterizes the fundamental limits of single-index bandit learning.",

Using exterior calculus, we extend this framework to the full family of convection-diffusion problems posed on $H(\\textbf{grad})$, $H(\\textbf{curl})$, and $H(\\text{div})$. The resulting formulation is based on a 4D Hodge-Laplacian operator with a spatiotemporal diffusion tensor and convection field, augmented by a small temporal perturbation to ensure nondegeneracy. This formulation naturally incorporates fundamental physical constraints, including divergence-free and curl-free conditions. We further introduce an exponentially-fitted 4D spatiotemporal flux operator that symmetrizes the convection-diffusion operator and enables a well-posed variational formulation.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the notion of intermediate dimensions introduced by Falconer et al., we introduce a continuum of topological entropies that are intermediate between the (Bowen) topological entropy and the lower and upper capacity topological entropies. This is achieved by restricting the families of allowable covers in the definition of topological entropy by requiring that the lengths of all strings used in a particular cover satisfy \\( N \\le n < N/\u03b8+ 1 \\), where \\( \u03b8\\in [0,1] \\) is a parameter. When \\( \u03b8= 1 \\), only covers using strings of the same length are allowed, and we recover the lower and upper capacity topological entropies; when \\( \u03b8= 0 \\), there are no restrictions, and the definition coincides with the topological entropy. We first establish a quantitative inequality for the upper and lower intermediate topological entropies, which mirrors the corresponding result for intermediate dimensions. As a consequence, the intermediate topological entropies are continuous on $(0,1]$, though discontinuity may arise at $0$; an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate this phenomenon. We then investigate several fundamental properties of the intermediate topological entropies for nonautonomous dynamical systems, including the power rule, monotonicity and product formulas. Finally, we derive an inequality relating intermediate entropies with respect to factor maps.",

The complex representation theory of the Brauer and Temperley--Lieb algebras is now fairly well understood, with each connecting in a different way to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory. The semisimple representation theory of the KY algebras is also understood, and thus interpolates, for example, between the double-factorial and Catalan combinatorial realms. However the non-semisimple representation theory has remained largely open, being harder overall than the (already challenging) Brauer case. In this paper we determine generalised Chebyshev-like forms for the determinants of gram matrices of contravariant forms for standard modules.\n  This generalises the root-of-unity paradigm for Temperley--Lieb algebras (and many related algebras); interpolating in various ways between this and the `integral paradigm' for Brauer algebras.\n  The standard module gram determinants give a huge amount of information about morphisms between standard modules, making thorough use of the powerful homological machinery of towers of recollement (ToR), with appropriate gram determinants providing the ToR `bootstrap'. As for the Brauer and TL cases the representation theory has a strongly alcove-geometric flavour, but the KY cases guide an intriguing generalisation of the overall geometric framework.",

This paper develops a solver-grade methodology centered on \\emph{incremental certificate learning}: we maximize the work performed in a sound linear relaxation (LP propagation, convex-hull constraints, stabilization), and invoke exact PWL reasoning only through a selective \\emph{exactness gate} when relaxations become inconclusive. Our architecture maintains a node-based search state together with a reusable global lemma store and a proof log. Learning occurs in two layers: (i) \\emph{linear lemmas} (cuts) whose validity is justified by checkable certificates, and (ii) \\emph{Boolean conflict clauses} extracted from infeasible guarded cores, enabling DPLL(T)-style pruning across nodes. We present an end-to-end algorithm (ICL-Verifier) and a companion hybrid pipeline (HSRV) combining relaxation pruning, exact checks, and branch-and-bound splitting. We prove soundness, and we state a conditional completeness result under exhaustive splitting for compact domains and PWL operators. Finally, we outline an experimental protocol against standardized benchmarks (VNN-LIB / VNN-COMP) to evaluate pruning effectiveness, learned-lemma reuse, and exact-gate efficiency.",

    "title": "Classification of ancient cylindrical mean curvature flows and the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture",
    "abstract": "We resolve the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture for mean curvature flows in all dimensions and for all types of cylindrical singularities. Specifically, we show that if the tangent flow at a singular point is a multiplicity-one cylinder, then in a neighborhood of that point the flow is mean-convex, its time-slices arise as level sets of a continuous function, and all nearby tangent flows are cylindrical. Moreover, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem near such points, which characterizes the flow via local models. We also obtain a more uniform version of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture, which only requires closeness to a cylinder at some initial time and yields a quantitative version of this structural description.\n  Our proof relies on a complete classification of ancient, asymptotically cylindrical flows. We prove that any such flow is non-collapsed, convex, rotationally symmetric, and belongs to one of three canonical families: ancient ovals, the bowl soliton, or the flying wing translating solitons. Central to our method is a refined asymptotic analysis and a novel \\emph{leading mode condition,} together with a new ``induction over thresholds'' argument. In addition, our approach provides a full parameterization of the space of asymptotically cylindrical flows and gives a new proof of the existence of flying wing solitons.\n  Our method is independent of prior work and, together with our prequel paper, this work is largely self-contained.",

    "abstract": "We investigate deep composite polynomial approximations of continuous but non-differentiable functions with algebraic cusp singularities. The functions in focus consist of finitely many cusp terms of the form $|x-a_j|^{\u03b1_j}$ with rational exponents $\u03b1_j\\in(0,1)$ on a real-analytic background. We propose a constructive approximation scheme that combines a division-free polynomial iteration for fractional powers with an outer layer for the analytic polynomial fitting. Our main result shows that this composite structure achieves exponential convergence in the the number of scalar coefficients in the inner and outer polynomial layers. Specifically, the $L^p([-1,1])$ approximation error, decays exponentially with respect to the parameter budget, in contrast to the algebraic rates obtained by classical single-layer polynomial approximation for cusp-type functions. Numerical experiments for both single and multiple cusp configurations confirm the theoretical rates and demonstrate the parameter efficiency of deep composite polynomial constructions.",

We first establish necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for these problems, providing a theoretical foundation for algorithm development.

    "abstract": "Decentralized optimization over directed graphs is essential for applications such as robotic swarms, sensor networks, and distributed learning. In many practical scenarios, the underlying network is a Time-Varying Broadcast Network (TVBN), where only row-stochastic mixing matrices can be constructed due to inaccessible out-degree information. Achieving exact convergence over TVBNs has remained a long-standing open question, as the limiting distribution of time-varying row-stochastic mixing matrices depends on unpredictable future graph realizations, rendering standard bias-correction techniques infeasible.\n  This paper resolves this open question by developing the first algorithm that achieves exact convergence using only time-varying row-stochastic matrices. We propose PULM (Pull-with-Memory), a gossip protocol that attains average consensus with exponential convergence by alternating between row-stochastic mixing and local adjustment. Building on PULM, we develop PULM-DGD, which converges to a stationary solution at $\\mathcal{O}(\\ln(T)/T)$ for smooth nonconvex objectives. Our results significantly extend decentralized optimization to highly dynamic communication environments.",

Traditionally, the HPS method takes as input an unstructured, high-order quadrilateral mesh and relies on tensor-product spectral discretizations on each element. To overcome this restriction, we introduce two complementary high-order strategies for triangular elements: a reduced quadrilateralization approach which is straightforward to implement, and triangle based spectral element method based on Dubiner polynomials. We show numerically that these extensions preserve the spectral accuracy, efficiency, and fast direct-solver structure of the HPS framework. The method is further extended to time dependent and evolving surfaces, and its performance is demonstrated through numerical experiments on reaction-diffusion systems, and geometry driven surface evolution.",

Incompatibility arises from phenomena such as intersections, self-intersections, and opposite taggings at punctures. To establish these identities, we develop a combinatorial-algebraic framework that relates loop graphs to certain representations. These skein relations can then be applied to investigate structural properties of cluster algebras from punctured surfaces. In particular, they can be used to prove the existence of bases satisfying natural positivity and compatibility conditions. This extends existing work on surface cluster algebras by incorporating punctures in the interior of the surface, thereby enlarging the class of cluster algebras for which such skein relations and bases can be constructed.",

We also define variants of such a coloring, like uniform quasi neighborhood balanced coloring, positive quasi neighborhood balanced coloring and negative quasi neighborhood balanced coloring based on the color of the extra neighbor of every vertex of odd degree of the graph G. We present several examples of graph classes that admit the various variants of quasi neighborhood balanced coloring. We also discuss various graph operations involving such graphs.

    "abstract": "We study finite-sum nonlinear programs whose decision variables interact locally according to a graph or hypergraph. We propose MP-Jacobi (Message Passing-Jacobi), a graph-compliant decentralized framework that couples min-sum message passing with Jacobi block updates. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters. At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving a cluster subproblem whose objective decomposes into (i) an intra-cluster term evaluated by a single min-sum sweep on the cluster tree (cost-to-go messages) and (ii) inter-cluster couplings handled via a Jacobi correction using neighbors' latest iterates. This design uses only single-hop communication and yields a convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.\n  For strongly convex objectives we establish global linear convergence and explicit rates that quantify how curvature, coupling strength, and the chosen partition affect scalability and provide guidance for clustering. To mitigate the computation and communication cost of exact message updates, we develop graph-compliant surrogates that preserve convergence while reducing per-iteration complexity. We further extend MP-Jacobi to hypergraphs; in heavily overlapping regimes, a surrogate-based hyperedge-splitting scheme restores finite-time intra-cluster message updates and maintains convergence. Experiments validate the theory and show consistent improvements over decentralized gradient baselines.",

We investigate the correlation between our notion of the Heinz mean constant and other well-known terms, viz., the modulus of convexity, modulus of smoothness, and rectangular constant. Furthermore, we also give a characterization of the Radon plane with an affine regular hexagonal unit sphere.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the steady self-propelled motion of a rigid body immersed in a three-dimensional incompressible viscous fluid governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The analysis is performed in a body-fixed reference frame, so that the fluid occupies an exterior domain and the propulsion mechanism is modeled through nonhomogeneous Navier-slip boundary conditions at the fluid-body interface. Such conditions provide a realistic description of propulsion in microfluidic and rough-surface regimes, where partial slip effects are significant. Under suitable smallness assumptions on the boundary flux and on the normal component of the prescribed surface velocity, we establish the existence of weak steady solutions to the coupled fluid-structure system. A key analytical ingredient is the derivation of a Korn-type inequality adapted to exterior domains with rigid-body motion and Navier-slip interfaces, which yields uniform control of both the fluid velocity and the translational and rotational velocities of the body. Beyond existence, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which a prescribed slip velocity on the body surface induces nontrivial translational or rotational motion of the rigid body. This is achieved through the introduction of a finite-dimensional thrust space, defined via auxiliary exterior Stokes problems with Navier boundary conditions, which captures the effective contribution of boundary-driven flows to the rigid-body motion. Our results clarify how boundary effects generate propulsion and extend the classical Dirichlet-based theory to the Navier-slip setting.",

Our construction is based on the correspondence between probabilistic cellular automata and Gibbs measures on their space-time trajectories, and a classical result on noise-resilient computing with cellular automata. The cellular automaton is constructed on the basis of Ammann's tiles, which are deterministic in one direction, and has non-periodic space-time trajectories corresponding to each valid tiling.

However, the resulting optimization model can be time-consuming to solve globally with exact methods. As a result, local search that exploits the neural-network structure has been employed to find good solutions within a reasonable time limit. For such methods, a lower per-iteration cost is advantageous when solving larger models. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we propose a gradient-based algorithm with lower per-iteration cost than existing methods. Second, we further adapt this algorithm to exploit the piecewise-linear structure of neural networks that use Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs).

Since the union of $t$ pairwise disjoint nontrivial blocking sets is a $t$-fold blocking set, it is conjectured that when $p^{n/s}$ is large enough w.r.t. $t$, then the minimum size of a $t$-fold blocking set in $\\mathrm{PG}(2,p^n)$ is $t(p^n+p^{n(s-1)/s}+1)$.

    "title": "Solving the inverse Source Problems for wave equation with final time measurements by a data driven approach",
    "abstract": "This paper develops a discrete data-driven approach for solving the inverse source problem of the wave equation with final time measurements. Focusing on the $L^2$-Tikhonov regularization method, we analyze its convergence under two different noise models, using noisy discrete spatial observations. By exploiting the spectral decomposition of the forward operator and introducing a noise separation technique into the variational framework, we establish error bounds for the reconstructed solution $u$ and the source term $f$ without requiring classical source conditions. Moreover, an expected convergence rate for the source error is derived in a weaker topology. We also extend the analysis to the fully discrete case with finite element discretization, showing that the overall error depends only on the noise level, regularization parameter, time step size, and spatial mesh size. These estimates provide a basis for selecting the optimal regularization parameter in a data-driven manner, without a priori information. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the existence and characterization of the value for a two-player zero-sum differential game with symmetric incomplete information on a continuum of initial positions and with signal revelation. Before the game starts, the initial position is chosen randomly according to a probability measure with compact support, and neither player is informed of the chosen initial position. However, they observe a public signal revealing the current state as soon as the trajectory of the dynamics hits a target set. We prove that, under a suitable notion of signal-dependent strategies, the value of the game exists, and the extended value function of the game is the unique viscosity solution of an associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation that satisfies a boundary condition.",

    "abstract": "Timesteppers constitute a powerful tool in modern computational science and engineering. Although they are typically used to advance the system forward in time, they can also be viewed as nonlinear mappings that implicitly encode steady states and stability information. In this work, we present an extension of the matrix-free framework for calculating, via timesteppers, steady states of deterministic systems to stochastic particle simulations, where intrinsic randomness prevents direct steady state extraction. By formulating stochastic timesteppers in the language of optimal transport, we reinterpret them as operators acting on probability measures rather than on individual particle trajectories. This perspective enables the construction of smooth cumulative- and inverse-cumulative-distribution-function ((I)CDF) timesteppers that evolve distributions rather than particles. Combined with matrix-free Newton-Krylov solvers, these smooth timesteppers allow efficient computation of steady-state distributions even under high stochastic noise. We perform an error analysis quantifying how noise affects finite-difference Jacobian action approximations, and demonstrate that convergence can be obtained even in high noise regimes. Finally, we introduce higher-dimensional generalizations based on smooth CDF-related representations of particles and validate their performance on a non-trivial two-dimensional distribution. Together, these developments establish a unified variational framework for computing meaningful steady states of both deterministic and stochastic timesteppers.",

    "abstract": "Multicommodity capacitated network design (MCND) models can be used to optimize the consolidation of shipments within e-commerce fulfillment networks. In practice, fulfillment networks require that shipments with the same origin and destination follow the same transfer path. This unsplittable flow requirement complicates the MCND problem, requiring integer programming (IP) formulations in which binary variables replace continuous flow variables. To enhance the solvability of this variant of the MCND problem for large-scale logistics networks, this work focuses on strengthening dual bounds. We investigate the polyhedra of arc-set relaxations, and we introduce two new classes of valid inequalities that can be implemented within solution approaches. We develop one approach that dynamically adds valid inequalities to the root node of a reformulation of the MCND IP with additional valid metric inequalities. We show the effectiveness of our ideas with a comprehensive computational study using path-based fulfillment instances, constructed from data provided by a large U.S.-based e-commerce company, and the well-known arc-based Canad instances. Experiments show that our best solution approach for a practical path-based model reduces the IP gap by an average of 26.5% and 22.5% for the two largest instance groups, compared to solving the reformulation alone, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the dual bound. In addition, experiments using only the arc-based relaxation highlight the strength of our new valid inequalities relative to the linear programming relaxation (LPR), yielding an IP-gap reduction of more than 85%.",

Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity.

The former question is studied in spectral geometry, and the latter is a central concern in numerical analysis. In this short expository survey we revisit the process of eigenvalue approximation, from the perspective of computational spectral geometry. Over the years a multitude of methods -- for discretizing the operator and for the resultant discrete system -- have been developed and analyzed in the field of numerical analysis. High-accuracy and provably convergent discretization approaches can be used to examine the interplay between the spectrum of an operator and the geometric properties of the spatial domain or manifold it is defined on. While computations have been used to guide conjectures in spectral geometry, in recent years approximation-theoretic tools and validated computations are also being used as part of proof strategies in spectral geometry.\n  Given a particular spectral feature of interest, should we discretize the original problem, or seek a reformulation? Of the many possible approximation strategies, which should we choose? These choices are inextricably linked to the objective: on the one hand, rapid, specialized methods are often ideal for conjecture formulation (prioritizing efficiency and accuracy), whereas schemes with guaranteed, computable error bounds are needed when computation is incorporated into a proof strategy. We also review instances where the demanding requirements of spectral geometry -- the need for rigorous error control or the robust calculation of higher eigenvalues -- motivate new developments in numerical analysis.",

Conventional cancellation methods such as the extensive cancellation algorithm require careful tuning and can distort the delay-Doppler response. This paper introduces a convex optimization framework that adaptively synthesizes per-cell delay-Doppler filters to suppress clutter while preserving the canonical cross-ambiguity function (CAF). The approach formulates a quadratic program that minimizes distortion of the CAF surface subject to linear clutter-suppression constraints, eliminating the need for a separate cancellation stage. Monte Carlo simulations using common communication waveforms demonstrate strong clutter suppression, accurate CFAR calibration, and major detection-rate gains over the classical CAF. The results highlight a scalable, CAF-faithful method for adaptive clutter mitigation in passive radar.",

    "abstract": "In 1871, Saint-Venant introduced the shallow water equations. Since then, the global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data of the multi-dimensional viscous Saint-Venant system have remained a well-known open problem. It was only recently that [Huang-Meng-Zhang, http:arXiv:2512.15029, 2025], under the assumption of radial symmetry, first proved the existence of global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the initial-boundary value problem of the two-dimensional viscous shallow water equations. At the same time, [Chen-Zhang-Zhu, http:arXiv:2512.18545, 2025] also independently proved the existence of global large solutions to the Cauchy problem of this system. Notably, in the work of Huang-Meng-Zhang, they also established the existence of global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy equality in both two and three dimensions, and the viscous shallow water equations are precisely a specific class of isentropic compressible fluids subject to the BD entropy equality. In this paper, we prove a new BD entropy inequality for a class of non-isentropic compressible fluids, which can be regarded as a generalization of the shallow water equations with transported entropy. Employing new estimates on the lower bound of density different from that of Huang-Meng-Zhang's work, we show the \"viscous shallow water system with transport entropy\" will admit global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the spherically symmetric initial-boundary value problem in both two and three dimensions. Our results also relax the restrictions on the dimension and adiabatic index imposed in Huang-Meng-Zhang's work on the shallow water equations, extending the range from $N=2,\\ \u03b3\\ge \\frac{3}{2}$ to $N=2,\\ \u03b3> 1$ and $N=3,\\ 1<\u03b3<3$.",

The first part focuses on novel algebraic and geometric approaches to the classification problem of coboundary Lie bialgebras up to Lie algebra automorphisms. More specifically, Grassmann, graded algebra and algebraic invariant techniques are discussed. Using these algebraic methods, equivalence classes of r-matrices for three-dimensional coboundary Lie bialgebras are studied. Moreover, particular higher-dimensional cases, e.g. $\\mathfrak{so}(2,2)$ and $\\mathfrak{so}(3,2)$, are partially analysed. From the geometric perspective, the main role is played by the newly introduced notion: the Darboux family. This powerful tool allows an efficient and thorough study of equivalence classes of r-matrices for four-dimensional indecomposable coboundary Lie bialgebras. In order to showcase its ability to tackle decomposable examples, $\\mathfrak{gl}_2$ is additionally studied. The second part of the Thesis sketches interesting directions for applications of r-matrices. Firstly, it is illustrated how r-matrices might be useful to describe foliated Lie-Hamilton systems. Secondly, the role of r-matrices in deformations of certain cases of Lie systems is discussed. In particular, based on the general procedure for deformations of Lie-Hamilton systems, its extension to Jacobi-Lie systems is suggested and supported by the detailed computation of the deformed Schwarz equation.",

In a parameter regime which leads to slow clicking (i.e. to a loss of the currently fittest class at a rate $\\ll 1/N$) we prove that the rescaled process of click times of the tournament ratchet converges as $N\\to \\infty$ to a Poisson process.

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can reshape wireless propagation on-demand. However, their performance is sensitive to UAV jitter and cascaded channel uncertainty. This paper investigates a downlink multiple-input single-output UAV-mounted RIS system in which a ground multiple-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users under practical impairments. Our goal is to maximize the expected throughput under stochastic three-dimensional UAV jitter and imperfect cascaded channel state information (CSI) based only on the available channel estimates. This leads to a stochastic nonconvex optimization problem subject to a BS transmit power constraint and strict unit-modulus constraints on all RIS elements. To address this problem, we design a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with a contextual bandit formulation. A differentiable feasibility layer is utilized to map continuous actions to feasible solutions, while the reward is a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected throughput. We instantiate this framework with constrained variants of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) that do not use target networks. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms yield higher throughput than conventional alternating optimization-based weighted minimum mean-square error (AO-WMMSE) baselines under severe jitter and low CSI quality. Across different scenarios, the proposed methods achieve performance that is either comparable to or slightly below the AO-WMMSE benchmark, based on sample average approximation (SAA) with a relative gap ranging from 0-12%. Moreover, the proposed DRL controllers achieve online inference times of 0.6 ms per decision versus roughly 370-550 ms for AO-WMMSE solvers.",

It allows the complex dynamics of high-dimensional oscillatory systems to be expressed by a single phase variable. This paper provides a detailed review and synthesis of phase reduction with two main goals. First, we develop a solid geometric framework for the theory by creating isochrons, which are the level sets of the asymptotic phase, using the Graph Transform theorem. We show that isochrons form an invariant, continuous structure of the basin of attraction of a stable limit cycle, helping to clarify the concept of the asymptotic phase. Second, we systematically explain how to derive the first-order phase reduction for weakly perturbed and coupled systems. In the end, we discuss the limitations of the first-order approach, particularly its restriction to very small perturbations and the issue of vanishing coupling terms in certain networks. We finish by outlining the framework and importance of higher-order phase reductions.

This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order.\n  As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the \u0141ojasiewicz-Simon inequality.\n  Our approach is independent of prior work and the paper is largely self-contained.",

The primary contribution of this work lies in establishing an inherent equivalence between the quartic inhomogeneous polynomial optimization problem and a multilinear optimization problem (MOP). This result extends the equivalence between fourth-order homogeneous polynomial optimization and multilinear optimization in the existing literature to the equivalence between fourth-order inhomogeneous polynomial optimization and multilinear optimization. By leveraging the multi-block structure embedded within the MOP, a tensor-based proximal alternating minimization algorithm is proposed to approximate the optimal value of the quartic problem. Under mild assumptions, the convergence of the algorithm is rigorously proven. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through preliminary computational results obtained using synthetic datasets.",

Though the filtered subspaces are not submodules either, the graded components are isomorphic to linear spaces which do have module structures. This works for any fixed degree of the functional forms. In this way, the condition that a functional form vanishes can be stated concisely with a module basis.

    "abstract": "We study a continuous time stochastic optimal control problem under partial observations that are available only at discrete time instants. This hybrid setting, with continuous dynamics and intermittent noisy measurements, arises in applications ranging from robotic exploration and target tracking to epidemic control. We formulate the problem on the space of beliefs (information states), treating the controller's posterior distribution of the state as the state variable for decision making. On this belief space we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle that provides necessary conditions for optimality. The analysis carefully tracks both the continuous evolution of the state between observation times and the Bayesian jump updates of the belief at observation instants.\n  A key insight is a relationship between the adjoint process in our maximum principle and the gradient of the value functional on the belief space, which links the optimality conditions to the dynamic programming approach on the space of probability measures. The resulting optimality system has a prediction and update structure that is closely related to the unnormalised Zakai equation and the normalised Kushner-Stratonovich equation in nonlinear filtering.\n  Building on this analysis, we design a particle based numerical scheme to approximate the coupled forward (filter) and backward (adjoint) system. The scheme uses particle filtering to represent the evolving belief and regression techniques to approximate the adjoint, which yields a practical algorithm for computing near optimal controls under partial information. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated on both linear and nonlinear examples and highlights in particular the benefits of actively controlling the observation process.",

    "abstract": "Optimal control provides a principled framework for transforming dynamical system models into intelligent decision-making, yet classical computational approaches are often too expensive for real-time deployment in dynamic or uncertain environments. In this work, we propose a method based on self-supervised neural operators for open-loop optimal control problems. It offers a new paradigm by directly approximating the mapping from system conditions to optimal control strategies, enabling instantaneous inference across diverse scenarios once trained. We further extend this framework to more complex settings, including dynamic or partially observed environments, by integrating the learned solution operator with Model Predictive Control (MPC). This yields a solution-operator learning method for closed-loop control, in which the learned operator supplies rapid predictions that replace the potentially time-consuming optimization step in conventional MPC. This acceleration comes with a quantifiable price to pay. Theoretically, we derive scaling laws that relate generalization error and sample/model complexity to the intrinsic dimension of the problem and the regularity of the optimal control function. Numerically, case studies show efficient, accurate real-time performance in low-intrinsic-dimension regimes, while accuracy degrades as problem complexity increases. Together, these results provide a balanced perspective: neural operators are a powerful novel tool for high-performance control when hidden low-dimensional structure can be exploited, yet they remain fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic dimensional complexity in more challenging settings.",

We identify three notions of topographic significance for ends in such graphs and show that the number of nonvanishing ends governs both amenability and smoothness. More precisely, we extend the Adams dichotomy from the pmp to the mcp setting, replacing the number of ends with the number of nonvanishing ends: an acyclic mcp graph is amenable if and only if a.e. component has at most two nonvanishing ends, while it is nowhere amenable exactly when a.e. component has a nonempty perfect (closed) set of nonvanishing ends. We also characterize smoothness: an acyclic mcp graph is essentially smooth if and only if a.e. component has no nonvanishing ends. Furthermore, we show that the notion of nonvanishing ends depends only on the measure class and not on the specific measure.\n  At the heart of our analysis lies the study of acyclic countable-to-one Borel functions. Our critical result is that, outside of the essentially two-ended setting, all back ends in a.e. orbit are vanishing and admit cocycle-finite geodesics. We also show that the number of barytropic ends controls the essential number of ends for such functions. This leads to a surprising topographic characterization of when such functions are essentially one-ended.\n  Our proofs utilize mass transport, end selection, and the notion of the Radon--Nikodym core for acyclic mcp graphs, a new concept that serves as a guiding framework for our topographic analysis.",

While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $\u03b8_0$ with current iterate $\u03b8_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(\u03b8_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $\u03b8_0$, $\u03b8_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.",

    "abstract": "We consider classification problems for manifolds and discrete subgroups of Lie groups from a descriptive set-theoretic point of view. This work is largely foundational in conception and character, recording both a framework for general study and Borel complexity computations for some of the most fundamental classes of manifolds. We show, for example, that for all $n\\geq 0$, the homeomorphism problem for compact topological $n$-manifolds is Borel equivalent to the relation $=_{\\mathbb{N}}$ of equality on the natural numbers, while the homeomorphism problem for noncompact topological $2$-manifolds is of maximal complexity among equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures. A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan--Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck--Zimmer and Andretta--Camerlo--Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth--Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $=_{\\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy. We close with a survey of the most immediate open questions.",

We show that classical Karp reductions can be viewed as zero-deficiency simulations, and that approximate reductions correspond to bounded deficiency. Furthermore, we establish the No-Free-Transfer Inequality, showing that strictly invariant representations inevitably destroy decision-relevant information.

Examples of Markov processes that fall into our general framework include traces of isotropic $\u03b1$-stable processes in $C^{1,\\rm Dini}$ sets, processes in Lipschitz sets arising in connection with the nonlocal Neumann problem, and a large class of resurrected self-similar processes in the closed upper half-space.\n  We establish sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for these Markov processes. A fundamental difficulty in accomplishing this task is that, in contrast to the existing literature on heat kernels for jump processes, the tails of the associated jump measures in our setting are not uniformly bounded. Thus, standard techniques in the existing literature used to study heat kernels are not applicable. To overcome this obstacle, we employ recently developed weighted functional inequalities specifically designed for jump kernels blowing up at the boundary.",

    "title": "Configuration Spaces of Finite Representation Type Algebras",
    "abstract": "To every finite-dimensional $\\mathbb C$-algebra $\u039b$ of finite representation type we associate an affine variety. These varieties are a large generalization of the varieties defined by \"$u$ variables\" satisfying \"$u$-equations\", first introduced in the context of open string theory and moduli space of ordered points on the real projective line by Koba and Nielsen, rediscovered by Brown as \"dihedral co-ordinates\", and recently generalized to any finite type hereditary algebras. We show that each such variety is irreducible and admits a rational parametrization. The assignment is functorial: algebra quotients correspond to monomial maps among the varieties. The non-negative real part of each variety has boundary strata that are controlled by Jasso reduction. These non-negative parts naturally define a generalization of open string integrals in physics, exhibiting factorization and splitting properties that do not come from a worldsheet picture. We further establish a family of Rogers dilogarithm identities extending results of Chapoton beyond the Dynkin case.",

    "title": "Penny graphs in the hyperbolic plane",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding the maximum number $e_d(n)$ of pairs of touching circles in a packing of $n$ congruent circles of diameter $d$ in the hyperbolic plane of curvature $-1$. In the Euclidean plane, the maximum comes from a spiral construction of the tiling of the plane with equilateral triangles (Harborth 1974), with a similar result in the hyperbolic plane for the values of $d$ corresponding to the order-$k$ triangular tilings (Bowen 2000). We present various upper and lower bounds for $e_d(n)$ for all values of $d > 0$. In particular, we prove that if $d > 0.66114\\dots$ except for $d=0.76217\\dots$, then the number of touching pairs is less than the one coming from a spiral construction in the order-$7$ triangular tiling, which we conjecture to be extremal. We also give a lower bound $e_d(n) > (2+\\varepsilon_d)n$ where $\\varepsilon_d > 1$ for all $d > 0$.",

    "abstract": "The thin-film equation $\\partial_t u = -\\nabla \\cdot (u^n \\nabla \u0394u)$ describes the evolution of the height $u=u(x,t)\\geq 0$ of a viscous thin liquid film spreading on a flat solid surface. We prove H\u00f6lder continuity of energy-dissipating weak solutions to the thin-film equation in the physically most relevant case of two spatial dimensions $d=2$. While an extensive existence theory of weak solutions to the thin-film equation was established more than two decades ago, even boundedness of weak solutions in $d=2$ has remained a major unsolved problem in the theory of the thin-film equation. Due the fourth-order structure of the thin-film equation, De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory is not applicable. Our proof is based on the hole-filling technique, the challenge being posed by the degenerate parabolicity of the fourth-order PDE.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we define the concept of an $S$-$k$-irreducible ideal and $S$-$k$-maximal ideal in a commutative semiring. We also establish several results concerning $S$-$k$-primary ideals and prove the existence theorem and the $S$-version of the uniqueness theorem using localization, for $S$-$k$-primary decompositions.\n  Also we show that the $S$-radical of every $S$-primary ideal is a prime ideal of $R$. Moreover, we investigate the structure of $S$-primary ideals in principal ideal semidomain and prove that each such ideal can be expressed of the form, $I = (vp^n)$, $n\\in \\mathbf{N}$ and for some $p \\in \\mathbf P -\\mathbf P_S$ and $v\\in R$ such that $(v)\\cap S\\neq \\varnothing $, where $\\mathbf P$ is the set of all irreducible (prime) elements of R and for a multiplicative subset $S\\subsetneq R$, the set $\\mathbf P_S$ defined by $\\mathbf P_S=\\{p\\in \\mathbf P : (p) \\cap S \\neq \\varnothing \\}$.",
