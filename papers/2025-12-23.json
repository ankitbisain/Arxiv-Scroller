    "abstract": "This paper considers the family of Schr\u00f6dinger operators on $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})$ given by independent but not necessarily identically distributed and possibly unbounded potentials. We assume a finite exponential moment and allow the choice of distributions to come from any compact set away from deterministic distributions. With these assumptions we prove spectral localization with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions as well as dynamical localization. One of the main tools is a Furstenberg-type theorem for non-stationary matrix products.",

    "abstract": "We provide theoretical foundations and computational tools for the systematic design of optimization-based control laws with constraints that have different priorities. By introducing the concept of prioritized intersections, we extend and unify previous work on the topic. Moreover, to enable the use of prioritized intersection in real-time applications, we propose an efficient solver for forming such intersections for polyhedral constraints. The solver in question is a tailored implementation of a dual active-set quadratic programming solver that leverages the particular problem structure of the optimization problems arising for prioritized intersections. The method is validated in a real-time MPC application for autonomous driving, where it successfully resolves six different levels of conflicting constraints, confirming its efficiency and practicality for control. Furthermore, we show that the proposed solver outperforms existing solvers for hierarchical quadratic programming, making it relevant beyond control applications.",

    "title": "Age of Information with Age-Dependent Server Selection",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a single-source multi-server generate-at-will discrete-time non-preemptive status update system where update packets are transmitted using {\\em only one} of the available servers, according to a server selection policy. In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \\emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "Incompressible flow solvers based on strong-form meshfree methods represent arbitrary geometries without the need for a global mesh system. However, their local evaluations make it difficult to satisfy incompressibility at the discrete level. Moreover, the collocated arrangement of velocity and pressure variables tends to induce a zero-energy mode, leading to decoupling between the two variables. In projection-based approaches, a spatial discretization scheme based on a conventional node-based moving least-squares method for the pressure causes inconsistency between the discrete operators on both sides of the Poisson equation. Thus, a solenoidal velocity field cannot be ensured numerically. In this study, a numerical method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is developed by introducing a local primal-dual grid into the mesh-constrained discrete point method, enabling consistent discrete operators. The \\textit{virtual} dual cell constructed is based on the local connectivity among nodes, and therefore our method remains truly meshfree. To achieve a consistent coupling between velocity and pressure variables under the primal-dual arrangement, time evolution converting is applied to evolve the velocity on cell interfaces. For numerical validation, a linear acoustic equation is solved to confirm the effectiveness of the staggered-variable arrangement based on the local primal-dual grid. Then, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved, and the proposed method is demonstrated to satisfy the condition of a solenoidal velocity field at the discrete level, achieve the expected spatial convergence order, and accurately reproduce flow features over a wide range of Reynolds numbers.",

While quasi-Newton methods are effective, their traditional application to MOPs is computationally expensive as they require maintaining and inverting separate Hessian approximations for each objective function. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Barzilai-Borwein diagonal-type Quasi-Newton method (BB-DQN). Our key innovation is the use of a single, shared, and modified BB-type matrix, updated iteratively using function and gradient information, to approximate the Hessians of all objectives simultaneously. We theoretically demonstrate that this approximation matrix remains positive definite throughout the iterative process. Furthermore, we establish the global convergence of the BB-DQN method without convexity assumptions and prove its R-linear convergence under mild conditions. Numerical experiments on a diverse set of test problems confirm that BB-DQN outperforms existing methods like M-BFGSMO, achieving superior performance in terms of computational time, iteration count, and reliability, especially for large-scale instances.",

    "title": "Central Limit Theorem for ergodic averages of Markov chains \\& the comparison of sampling algorithms for heavy-tailed distributions",
    "abstract": "Establishing central limit theorems (CLTs) for ergodic averages of Markov chains is a fundamental problem in probability and its applications. Since the seminal work~\\cite{MR834478}, a vast literature has emerged on the sufficient conditions for such CLTs. To counterbalance this, the present paper provides verifiable necessary conditions for CLTs of ergodic averages of Markov chains on general state spaces. Our theory is based on drift conditions, which also yield lower bounds on the rates of convergence to stationarity in various metrics.\n  The validity of the ergodic CLT is of particular importance for sampling algorithms, where it underpins the error analysis of estimators in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Although heavy-tailed sampling is of central importance in applications, the characterisation of the CLT and the convergence rates are theoretically poorly understood for almost all practically-used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. In this setting our results provide sharp conditions on the validity of the ergodic CLT and establish convergence rates for large families of MCMC sampling algorithms for heavy-tailed targets. Our study includes a rather complete analyses for random walk Metropolis samplers (with finite- and infinite-variance proposals), Metropolis-adjusted and unadjusted Langevin algorithms and the stereographic projection sampler (as well as the independence sampler). By providing these sharp results via our practical drift conditions, our theory offers significant insights into the problems of algorithm selection and comparison for sampling heavy-tailed distributions (see short YouTube presentations~\\cite{YouTube_talk} describing our \\href{https://youtu.be/m2y7U4cEqy4}{\\underline{theory}} and \\href{https://youtu.be/w8I_oOweuko}{\\underline{applications}}).",

The region of absolute stability of this method contains that of a RK6 and is tangent to the region [-5.626,0[x[-4.730,4.730] of the complex plane, containing a significant part of the imaginary axis. Numerical experiments with standard test problems for stiff systems of ODEs show that DC6RK2/4 performs well on problems regarding strong non-linearity and long-term integration, and this method does not require extremely small time steps for accurate numerical solutions of stiff problems. Moreover, this method is better than standard implicit methods like the Backward Differentiation Formulae and the DC methods for the implicit midpoint rule on stiff problems for which Jacobian matrices along the solution curve have complex eigenvalues where imaginary parts have larger magnitudes than real parts. An application of DC6RK2/4 to a class of test problems for reaction-diffusion equations in one dimensional is also carried out.",

For functions whose energy is close to that of a finite superposition of bubbles, we prove that the Euler-Lagrange deficit controls linearly the distance, in the homogeneous fractional Sobolev norm, to the multi-bubble manifold, and we recover the precise bubble configuration. This yields quantitative rigidity under arbitrary finite weak interactions. The proof combines a localization scheme adapted to the Hardy weight, weighted fractional Kato-Ponce commutator estimates, a bubble-wise spectral gap inequality, and a sharp interaction analysis. We also show that the linear rate is optimal by constructing a matching counterexample.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a constructive bijection between a conditioned spanning forest of the wheel graph $W_{n+1}$ and a spanning tree of the fan graph $F_n$. In addition, by applying the effective resistance formula obtained by Bapat and Gupta \\cite{bapat-gupta}, we derive an explicit formula for the number of two-component spanning forests of $W_{n+1}$ in which two specified vertices $u$ and $v$ lie in distinct components. Based on this result, we obtain explicit formulas for the following three conditioned two-component spanning forests $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_2)$, $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_3)$, and $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_c)$. These formulas are $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_2)=2(f_{2n-1}-1)$, $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_3)=2(\\ell_{2n-2}-3)$, $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\\mid v_c)=f_{2n}$, where $f_i$ and $\\ell_j$ denote the $i$-th Fibonacci number and $j$-th Lucas number, respectively. As these identities show, the enumerations naturally lead to formulas involving Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers. Taken together, these two approaches show a unified perspective. One is the constructive combinatorial bijection, and the other is the analytic method based on effective resistance. Together they provide a new integrated framework for studying the structure of spanning forests on $W_{n+1}$.",

It is shown that the dynamics of the ratio $y=R/B$ reduce to the Riccati equation $\\dot y=\u03b1y^2-\u03b2$, which admits a complete analytical study. The main result is that asymptotically stable invariant sets in the positive quadrant $R,B\\ge 0$ exist exactly in three sign cases of $(\u03b1,\u03b2)$: (i) $\u03b1<0,\u03b2<0$ (stable interior equilibrium), (ii) $\u03b1=0,\u03b2<0$ (the face $B=0$ is stable), (iii) $\u03b1<0,\u03b2=0$ (the face $R=0$ is stable). For $\u03b1>0$ or $\u03b2>0$ the solutions reach the boundaries of applicability of the model in finite time. Moreover, $\u03b1<0,\u03b2<0$ corresponds to exponential growth of solutions in the original system.

The standard result that angular indices $(\\ell,m)$ must be integers is shown to be a consequence of domain constraints -- regularity at both poles and single-valuedness in the azimuthal coordinate -- rather than a requirement imposed by Maxwell's equations themselves. We prove that, for the sectoral case $\u03bd=m$, the function $\\sin^{m}\u03b8$ exactly solves the angular eigenvalue equation for any real $m>0$, giving rise to a continuous dispersion curve. We demonstrate why non-sectoral modes (tesseral and zonal) appear only at isolated integer points on the full sphere, and show how boundary modifications such as cones and wedges convert these isolated points into continuous families of modes. Complete field solutions, wave impedances, and energy integrability conditions are derived. At the limiting point $(\u03bd, m) = (0, 0)$, the electromagnetic field vanishes identically while the underlying Debye potential remains non-trivial -- a distinction with implications for mode counting that connects to longstanding questions in gauge theory and cavity quantization. Full-wave simulations validate the theoretical predictions with sub-percent accuracy. These results raise the possibility of structural analogues in wave equations on curved spacetimes, where conical deficits or horizon excisions similarly modify the angular domain.",

We present a concise, reproducible discrete-event implementation of transport coding in OMNeT++, including a multi-hop Kleinrock-type network, FIFO queues, exponential service and link delays, and explicit receiver-side reconstruction that records message delay and deadline violations. Using paired uncoded ($n{=}k$) and coded ($n{>}k$) configurations at the same message generation rate, we compare delay, reliability, and saturation effects across code rates and input loads. Simulation results show consistent reductions of average delay and late-delivery probability for moderate redundancy, while keeping the saturation throughput close to the uncoded baseline. The proposed model provides a transparent bridge between analytical transport-coding formulas and executable simulation for tuning redundancy in low-latency services.",

This paper introduces the \\textbf{Orbit-Summability Fixed Point Criterion}, a novel, purely dynamical condition, and establishes its profound connection to \\textbf{Caristi`s Fixed Point Theorem} in complete metric spaces.\n  Our criterion, which requires only that the total displacement along a single orbit be finite (the orbit-summability property), provides a practical and concrete tool for checking the existence of fixed points without relying on the construction of an abstract potential function.\n  We demonstrate that, under a minimal regularity assumption involving the function $f$ and the metric $d$, the Orbit-Summability Criterion is \\textbf{precisely equivalent} to Caristi`s Fixed Point Theorem. This equivalence is conceptually significant as it creates a direct bridge between the geometric principle of \\textbf{dynamical gap summability} (akin to the core idea in Banach`s Contraction Principle) and the variational principle of Caristi.\n  As a direct consequence of this equivalence, the classical \\textbf{Banach Contraction Principle is recovered as a straightforward corollary}. The methodology is designed to merge key elements from the Banach proof (orbit convergence via summability) with the structural requirements of Caristi (majorization by a well-behaved functional), effectively providing a unifying framework for these fundamental results. Thus, the Orbit-Summability Criterion offers an attractive and accessible perspective on these established cornerstones of Fixed Point Theory.",

This format can be viewed as a DNN with width exponential in the input dimension and structured weights matrices. Compared to DNNs, this format enables controlled compression at the layer level using efficient tensor algebra. On the optimization side, we derive a layerwise algorithm inspired by natural gradient descent, allowing to exploit efficient low-rank tensor algebra. This relies on low-rank estimations of Gram matrices, and tensor structured random sketching. Viewing the format as a discrete dynamical system, we also derive an optimization algorithm inspired by numerical methods in optimal control. Numerical experiments on regression tasks demonstrate the expressivity of the new format and the relevance of the proposed optimization algorithms. Overall, CTTs combine the expressivity of compositional models with the algorithmic efficiency of tensor algebra, offering a scalable alternative to standard deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "This paper further studies the model companion of an endomorphism acting on a vector space, possibly with extra structure.

We previously defined a family $\\{T^C_\u03b8: C \\in \\mathcal{C}\\}$ of extensions of $T_\u03b8$ which parameterizes all consistent extensions of the form $$\n  T_\u03b8\\cup \\left\\{\\sum\\nolimits_{k}\\bigcap\\nolimits_{l}\\operatorname{Ker}(\u03c1_{j, k, l}[\u03b8]) = \\sum\\nolimits_{k}\\bigcap\\nolimits_{l} \\operatorname{Ker}(\u03b7_{j, k, l}[\u03b8]) : j \\in \\mathcal{J}\\right\\}, $$ where all sums and intersections are finite, and all the $\u03c1[\u03b8]$'s and $\u03b7[\u03b8]$'s are polynomials over $K$ with $\u03b8$ plugged in.

We also presented a sufficient condition which implies that every $T^C_\u03b8$ has a model companion $T\u03b8^C$. Under this condition, we characterize all definable sets in $T\u03b8^C$ and use this to study the completions of $T\u03b8^C$, as well as the algebraic closure. If $T$ is o-minimal and extends $\\operatorname{Th}(\\mathbb{R}, <)$, we prove that $T\u03b8^C$ has o-minimal open core.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a construction and existence proof for a 1-parameter family of chiral unbalanced triply-periodic minimal surfaces of genus 4. We name these {\\textit{gyrating H'-T} surfaces, because they are related to Schoen's H'-T surfaces in a similar way as the Gyroid is to the Primitive surface. Their chirality is manifest in a screw symmetry of order six. The two labyrinthine domains on either side of the surface are not congruent, rather one representing the quartz net (\\texttt{qtz}) and the other one the dual of the quartz net (\\texttt{qzd}). The family tends to the Scherk saddle tower in one limit and to the doubly periodic Scherk surface in the other. The motivation for the construction was to construct a chiral tunable unbalanced surface family, originally as a template for photonic materials. The numeric construction is based on reverse-engineering of the tubular surface of two suitably chosen dual nets, using the \\textit{Surface Evolver}} to minimize area or curvature variations. The existence is proved using Weierstrass parametrizations defined on the branched torus.",

    "abstract": "We develop a comprehensive analytical and numerical framework for boundary integral equations (BIEs) of the 2D Lam\u00e9 system on cornered domains. By applying local Mellin analysis on a wedge, we obtain a factorizable characteristic equation for the singular exponents of the boundary densities, and clarify their dependence on boundary conditions. The Fredholm well-posedness of the BIEs on cornered domains is proved in weighted Sobolev spaces. We further construct an explicit density-to-Taylor mapping for the BIE and show its invertibility for all but a countable set of angles. Based on these analytical results, we propose a singularity guided Nystr\u00f6m (SGN) scheme for the numerical solution of BIEs on cornered domains. The SGN uses the computed corner exponents and a Legendre-tail indicator to drive panel refinement. An error analysis that combines this refinement strategy with an exponentially accurate far-field quadrature rule is provided. Numerical experiments across various cornered geometries demonstrate that SGN obtains higher order accuracy than uniform Nystr\u00f6m method and reveal a crowding-limited regime for domains with re-entrant angles.",

Specifically, we address special matrices such as shifted $r$-th power lattices, Vandermonde matrices, and circulant matrices, analyzing the phenomenon where the value of $APD_m(A)$ remains zero as $m$ increases until a specific degree (the first appearance phenomenon). In particular, we explore closed-form formulas for the first appearance degree $m_1(A)$ and the first appearance value $APD_{m_1}(A)$, presenting Conjectures that hold across multiple matrix classes.

The system consists of three coupled equations that represent the longitudinal displacements of the outer layers and the transverse displacement of the composite beam, all of which are coupled with dynamical boundary conditions. In the first problem, time-dependent weights and delays are considered. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Cauchy problem associated with the damped system using semigroup theory and a classical result by Kato. Furthermore, employing a Lyapunov-based approach, we prove that the system's energy decays exponentially, despite the presence of time-varying weights and delays. In the second problem, we consider a boundary linear control system and prove its well-posedness. By deriving an observability inequality for the adjoint system and applying the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM), we show that the system is null controllable. A key contribution of this work lies in handling the full three-equation coupled system, which involves significant difficulty due to the dynamic boundary conditions, resolved via appropriately constructed Lyapunov functionals and intermediate observability inequalities.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the \\emph{equilibrium fluctuations} of a Hamiltonian chain of oscillators on \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) with an exponential potential, perturbed by a conservative, symmetric noise. Under the canonical \\emph{diffusive scaling} \\(t \\mapsto t n^2\\) and an interaction strength tuned by \\(n^{-1/2}\\), the fluctuation field is known to converge to the \\emph{energy solution} of the stochastic Burgers equation (SBE) on the torus~\\cite{ABGS22}. We introduce a \\emph{coupled moving heat bath} of strength \\(n^{-\u03b4}\\) acting on the particle system. We prove that for \\(\u03b4\\leq 1\\) (the \\emph{strong-coupling regime}), the equilibrium fluctuation field converges to the \\emph{energy solution of the SBE with a Dirichlet boundary condition at zero}. We provide two distinct analytical characterizations of these boundary solutions, corresponding to different spaces of test functions. Conversely, for \\(\u03b4> 1\\) (the \\emph{weak-coupling regime}), the heat bath becomes irrelevant in the scaling limit: the fluctuations converge to the standard SBE on the full line without any boundary condition, reproducing the full-line result of~\\cite{GJ14}. Our analysis thus reveals a sharp \\emph{critical scaling} in the coupling strength \\(\u03b4\\), which dictates the emergence -- or absence -- of a macroscopic boundary condition from the microscopic perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Many network datasets exhibit connectivity with variance by resolution and large-scale organization that coexists with localized departures. When vertices have observed ordering or embedding, such as geography in spatial and village networks, or anatomical coordinates in connectomes, learning where and at what resolution connectivity departs from a baseline is crucial. Standard models typically emphasize a single representation, i.e. stochastic block models prioritize coarse partitions, latent space models prioritize global geometry, small-world generators capture local clustering with random shortcuts, and graphon formulations are fully general and do not solely supply a canonical multiresolution parameterization for interpretation and regularization. We introduce wavelet latent position exponential random graphs (WL-ERGs), an exchangeable logistic-graphon framework in which the log-odds connectivity kernel is represented in compactly supported orthonormal wavelet coordinates and mapped to edge probabilities through a logistic link. Wavelet coefficients are indexed by resolution and location, which allows multiscale structure to become sparse and directly interpretable. Although edges remain independent given latent coordinates, any finite truncation yields a conditional exponential family whose sufficient statistics are multiscale wavelet interaction counts and conditional laws admit a maximum-entropy characterization. These characteristics enable likelihood-based regularization and testing directly in coefficient space. The theory is naturally scale-resolved and includes universality for broad classes of logistic graphons, near-minimax estimation under multiscale sparsity, scale-indexed recovery and detection thresholds, and a band-limited regime in which canonical coefficient-space tilts are non-degenerate and satisfy a finite-dimensional large deviation principle.",

This paper develops a static, graphon level version of Bayesian predictive synthesis for random networks. At the graphon level we show that Bayesian predictive synthesis corresponds to the integrated squared error projection of the true graphon onto the linear span of the agent graphons. We derive nonasymptotic oracle inequalities and prove that least-squares graphon-BPS, based on a finite number of edge observations, achieves the minimax L^2 rate over this agent span. Moreover, we show that any estimator that selects a single agent graphon is uniformly inconsistent on a nontrivial subset of the convex hull of the agents, whereas graphon-level Bayesian predictive synthesis remains minimax-rate optimal-formalizing a combination beats components phenomenon. Structural properties of the underlying random graphs are controlled through explicit Lipschitz bounds that transfer graphon error into error for edge density, degree distributions, subgraph densities, clustering coefficients, and giant component phase transitions. Finally, we develop a heavy tail theory for Bayesian predictive synthesis, showing how mixtures and entropic tilts preserve regularly varying degree distributions and how exponential random graph model agents remain within their family under log linear tilting with Kullback-Leibler optimal moment calibration.",

The proposed method achieves optimal error estimates through three principal contributions: (i) an extended maximum principle, coupled with an asymptotic consistency analysis of the flux operator, which establishes second-order convergence of nonlocal solutions to their local counterparts in the maximum norm; (ii) a Nitsche-type formulation that directly incorporates nonlocal jump conditions into the weak form, enabling high accuracy without body-fitted meshes; and (iii) a rigorous proof of optimal convergence rates in both the energy and L2 norms via the nonlocal maximum principle, flux consistency, and a newly derived nonlocal Poincare inequality. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach, thereby providing a foundation for extensions to higher dimensions.",

In our models, vertices arrive sequentially and connect independently to each earlier vertex $v$ with probability proportional to a nonpositive power of the arrival time of $v$, continuing until the graph has $n$ vertices. This class includes uniformly grown random graphs and inhomogeneous random graphs of preferential-attachment type. Whenever the critical percolation threshold is positive, we show that the critical window has width of order $(\\log n)^{-2}$ and a secondary phase transition at its finite upper boundary. Inside this window the largest component has size of order $\\sqrt{n}/\\log n$, and the susceptibility remains finite and independent of the position in the window. The proofs couple component explorations to branching random walks killed outside an interval of length $\\log n$, allowing sharp control of the barely subcritical and critical regimes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the finite time blow-up of strong solutions to the compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system (without magnetic diffusion) coupled with entropy transport, and derive an upper bound for the lifespan of such solutions. We first establish the local well-posedness of strong solutions for bounded domains and study the mechanism of finite-time singularity formation in the 2D radially symmetric case and 3D cylindrically symmetric case. We prove that if the initial density vanishes in an interior region containing the origin and the magnetic field is non-trivial within this vacuum region, the strong solution must blow up in finite time. These results generalize and improve the previous results of Huang-Xin-Yan [Math. Ann. 392 (2025) 2365-2394] for the compressible isentropic MHD equations. Significantly, we extend this blow-up result to the free boundary problem. Our analysis of the boundary's expansion allows us to explicitly estimate the maximum lifespan of the solution.",

This Markovian dynamical system describes the core computational process of structure formation and transformation in syntax via the Merge operation, according to Chomsky's Minimalism model of generative linguistics. The dynamics decomposes into an ergodic dynamical system with uniform stationary distribution, given by the action of Internal Merge, while the contributions of External Merge and (a minimal form of) Sideward Merge reduce to a simpler Markov chain with state space the set of partitions and with combinatorial weights. The Sideward Merge part of the dynamics prevents convergence to fully formed connected structures (trees), unless the different forms of Merge are weighted by a cost function, as predicted by linguistic theory. Results on the asymptotic behavior of the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and eigenvector in this weighted case, obtained in terms of an associated Perron-Frobenius problem in the tropical semiring, show that the usual cost functions (Minimal Search and Resource Restrictions) proposed in the linguistic literature do not suffice to obtain convergence to the tree structures, while an additional optimization property based on the Shannon entropy achieves the expected result for the dynamics. We also comment on the introduction of continuous parameters related to semantic embedding and other computational models, and also on some filtering of the dynamics by coloring rules that model the linguistic filtering by theta roles and phase structure, and on parametric variation and the process of parameter setting in Externalization.",

At each time step, interacting pairs update their layer-specific states using layer-dependent, time-varying interaction rates and a random sign (attractive or repulsive), and the resulting updates are averaged across layers. This framework generalizes classical gossip and Deffuant-type models while capturing heterogeneous cross-layer influences and antagonistic interactions.\n  Under mild graph-theoretic and moment assumptions, we establish almost sure global consensus. Specifically, when the expected net effect of interactions is strictly attractive and random matchings ensure sufficient cross-layer connectivity, all agents' layer states converge almost surely to the global average. We further identify a purely attractive regime in which consensus holds even under intermittent connectivity and without any moment assumptions on the initial states. Numerical experiments illustrate the dynamical regimes predicted by the theory, including consensus, metastability, and polarization. Together, these results provide a rigorous foundation for understanding how multilayer structure, stochastic interactions, and mixed-sign influence shape collective outcomes in social and engineered networked systems.",

    "abstract": "In this contribution, we study scalar nonlocal conservation laws with the $p$-norm. Here, 'nonlocal' means that the velocity of the conservation law depends on an integral term in space. Typically, the nonlocal term consists of integrating the solution in $L^{1}$, whereas here we will study the case when the solution is integrated in the $L^{p}$-norm. We consider even the case of the $L^{p}$ metric when $p\\in (0,1)$ and establish, for an initial datum which is uniformly bounded away from zero, the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions. We then demonstrate that there are also solutions to the initial datum being zero under more restrictive assumptions. Furthermore, we investigate the singular limit, i.e., what happens when the nonlocal kernel converges to a Dirac distribution. Indeed, for the one-sided exponential kernel, we recover the (entropy) solution of the corresponding local conservation law for all $p\\in(0,\\infty)$ with further restrictions for $p\\in(0,1)$. This generalizes the celebrated singular limit result for nonlocal conservation laws for $p=1$ significantly and showcases the robustness of the approximation of local conservation laws by nonlocal ones. We investigate also the monotonicity of the solution when assuming that the initial datum is monotone. Finally, we prove the convergence of solutions for $p\\rightarrow 0$ on a small time horizon, resulting in a different kind of nonlocal conservation law. Numerical studies showcasing the effect of $p$ on the singular limit convergence and more conclude the contribution.",

    "abstract": "Spectral bias implies an imbalance in training dynamics, whereby high-frequency components may converge substantially more slowly than low-frequency ones. To alleviate this issue, we propose a cross-attention-based architecture that adaptively reweights a scaled multiscale random Fourier feature bank with learnable scaling factors. The learnable scaling adjusts the amplitudes of the multiscale random Fourier features, while the cross-attention residual structure provides an input-dependent mechanism to emphasize the most informative scales. As a result, the proposed design accelerates high-frequency convergence relative to comparable baselines built on the same multiscale bank. Moreover, the attention module supports incremental spectral enrichment: dominant Fourier modes extracted from intermediate approximations via discrete Fourier analysis can be appended to the feature bank and used in subsequent training, without modifying the backbone architecture.\n  We further extend this framework to PDE learning by introducing a linear combination of two sub-networks: one specialized in capturing high-frequency components of the PDE solution and the other in capturing low-frequency components, with a learnable (or optimally chosen) mixing factor to balance the two contributions and improve training efficiency in oscillatory regimes. Numerical experiments on high-frequency and discontinuous regression problems, image reconstruction tasks, as well as representative PDE examples, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",

In the Prekopa-Leindler case, the proof gives a generalization that seems to be new, which interpolates the classical three and the recent four function versions.",

Under this strategy, the constellation operator addresses satellite failures in two ways: by deploying new satellites and by recovering failed satellites through OOS. We develop an inventory management model with a parametric replenishment policy for the maintenance process, which can evaluate the performance of the satellite constellation system. Based on this model, we formulate two single-objective optimization problems representing the decision-making contexts of two main stakeholders -- the constellation operator and the OOS provider -- and a bi-objective optimization problem that can reflect the tension between the two. A case study of the OOS-supported maintenance for a real-world-scale constellation provides valuable insights that help explain the behaviors of the stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a bi-level optimal control framework for designing low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with robustness against missed-thrust-events. The upper-level (UL) problem generates a nominal trajectory assuming full control authority, while each lower-level (LL) problem computes the optimal recovery maneuver following a missed-thrust-event along the nominal solution. Under suitable regularity conditions ensuring uniqueness and smoothness of the LL response, the hierarchy admits a single-level reformulation by embedding the LL first-order optimality conditions within the UL constraints. We further establish a robustness certificate, which provides an upper bound on the maximum admissible missed-thrust-duration for which the structural assumptions remain valid for the LL problem. The bound depends explicitly on precomputable dynamical quantities along the nominal solution, enabling rapid evaluation over large ensembles without iterative solves. Numerical experiments show that while the certificate identifies when modeling assumptions are valid, it does not fully characterize recoverability after missed-thrust-events. A finite-horizon controllability-energy analysis is therefore used to interpret recovery beyond the theoretical bounds. Collectively, these results provide a deterministic, certifiable approach for incorporating robustness directly into trajectory design, replacing post-hoc margin allocation techniques with formal guarantees.",

These results substantially broaden the scope of existing lower bounds. To complement them, we show that Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum Variance Reduction (NSGD-MVR), a known algorithm, matches these bounds in expectation. Beyond expectation guarantees, we introduce a new algorithm, Double-Clipped NSGD-MVR, which allows the derivation of high-probability convergence rates under weaker assumptions than previous works. Finally, for second-order methods with stochastic Hessians satisfying bounded $q$-th central moment assumptions for some exponent $q \\in [1, 2]$ (allowing $q \\neq p$), we establish sharper lower bounds than previous works while improving over Sadiev et al.

    "abstract": "We investigate real-time tracking of two correlated stochastic processes over a shared wireless channel. The joint evolution of the processes is modeled as a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain. Each process is observed by a dedicated sampler and independently reconstructed at a remote monitor according to a task-specific objective. Although both processes originate from a common underlying phenomenon (e.g., distinct features of the same source), each monitor is interested only in its corresponding feature. A reconstruction error is incurred when the true and reconstructed states mismatch at one or both monitors. To address this problem, we propose an error-aware joint sampling and transmission policy, under which each sampler probabilistically generates samples only when the current process state differs from the most recently reconstructed state at its corresponding monitor. We adopt the time-averaged reconstruction error as the primary performance metric and benchmark the proposed policy against state-of-the-art joint sampling and transmission schemes. For each policy, we derive closed-form expressions for the resulting time-averaged reconstruction error. We further formulate and solve an optimization problem that minimizes the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to an average sampling cost constraint. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed error-aware policy achieves the minimum time-averaged reconstruction error among the considered schemes while efficiently utilizing the sampling budget. The performance gains are particularly pronounced in regimes with strong inter-process correlation and stringent tracking requirements, where frequent sampling by both samplers is necessary.",

In this article, we primarily introduce the concepts of rough weighted ideal limit set and rough weighted ideal cluster points set associated with sequences in normed spaces. Building on these concepts, we derive several important results, including a characterization of maximal ideals, a representation of closed sets in normed spaces, and an analysis of the minimal convergent degree required for the rough weighted ideal limit set to be non-empty. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for an analytic $P$-ideal, the rough weighted ideal limit set forms an $F_{\u03c3\u03b4}$ subset of the normed space. Finally, we introduce the concept of weighted equi-ideal convergence for sequences of functions with respect to analytic $P$-ideals, extending the notion of equi-statistical convergence [Balcerzak et al., J.

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communications (SATCOM) offers high-throughput, low-latency global connectivity to a very large number of users. To accommodate this demand with limited hardware resources, beam hopping (BH) has emerged as a prominent approach in LEO SATCOM. However, its time-domain switching mechanism confines coverage to a small fraction of the service area during each time slot, exacerbating uplink throughput bottlenecks and latency issues as the user density increases. Meanwhile, wideband systems experience the beam-squint effect, where analog beamforming (BF) directions vary with subcarrier frequencies, potentially causing misalignment at certain frequencies, thereby hindering the performance of wideband SATCOM. In this paper, we aim to shift the paradigm in wideband LEO SATCOM from beam-squint as an impairment to beam-squint as an asset. Specifically, we put forth 3D rainbow BF employing a joint phase-time array (JPTA) antenna with true time delay (TTD) to intentionally widen the beam-squint angle, steering frequency-dependent beams toward distributed directions. This novel approach enables the satellite to serve its entire coverage area in a single time slot. By doing so, the satellite simultaneously receives uplink signals from a massive number of users, significantly boosting throughput and reducing latency. To realize 3D rainbow BF, we formulate a JPTA beamformer optimization problem and address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem through a novel joint alternating and decomposition-based optimization framework. Through numerical evaluations incorporating realistic 3D LEO SATCOM geometry, our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed rainbow BF-empowered LEO SATCOM achieves up to 2.8-fold increase in uplink throughput compared to conventional BH systems. These results mark a significant breakthrough for 6G wideband LEO SATCOM.",

Under two different assumptions on the initial data, we establish two sharp criteria (i.e., the critical thresholds in Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2) governing the global existence and finite-time blow-up of solutions. Once the initial free energy is less than a constant that depends on the total mass (or depends on the extremum function of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality), the first criterion depends on the relationship between the $L^{\\frac{2d}{2d-\u03b3}}$-norm of initial data and total mass, while the second relies on the relationship between the $L^m$-norm of initial data and extremal function.\n  In the discussion of the second criterion, we do not require $L^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ boundedness of the initial data, which is necessary in reference \\cite{B}. Furthermore, with the help of moment estimate, we manage to prove the compactness argument on the whole space by using the Lions-Aubin Lemma.\n  Importantly, we demonstrate that the two initial free energy conditions on which two criteria are based are equivalent. Building on this, we further prove that the two sharp criteria themselves are also equivalent, thereby unifying the classification results obtained from two different approaches.",

    "abstract": "In the 1950s, W. Feller characterized the most general Brownian motion on the closed half-line. He showed that any such process is a mixture of reflected, sticky, and killed Brownian motions. By most general Brownian motion, we mean a strong Markov process whose excursions away from zero coincide with those of standard Brownian motion, and which may be sent to the cemetery state upon hitting zero. In this work, we fully characterize the most general Brownian motion on the whole real line and on the union of two closed half-lines. Our results are twofold. First, we show that the most general Brownian motion on the line is the process known in the literature as the Skew Sticky Brownian Motion Killed at Zero (see Borodin and Salminen's book). Second, we prove that the most general Brownian motion on two closed half-lines is a process, which we call the Skew Sticky Killed at Zero Snapping Out Brownian Motion. This process extends the Snapping Out Brownian Motion introduced by A. Lejay in 2016.",

We analyze the properties of LMEs from a data center's perspective in a 1493-bus Western Interconnection over one year of hourly operation. We find that LME characteristics create three distinct regions: the hydropower-dominated Pacific Northwest, with low and stable LMEs; the coal-heavy Intermountain West, containing often high LMEs; and the Sunbelt, where mixed generation leads to variable LMEs correlated with solar output. This characterization provides analytical guidance for data center emission reduction. In particular, LME-guided emission reduction interventions through data center temporal-spatial load shifting, siting, and renewable procurement display over 85% accuracy with respect to actual emission reduction. Moreover, large-scale, nodal grid simulation is shown to be critical to accurate evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The Ekman boundary layer is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that describes fluid motion near boundaries affected by Earth's rotation. Most theoretical studies have simplified their analysis by assuming a planar boundary surface, resulting in limited exploration of structures with general smooth boundary conditions. Investigating the impact of boundary geometry in the Ekman boundary layer is essential, as initially suggested by J.L. Lions and further examined in Masmoudi's study [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432-483] under small amplitude periodic boundary conditions. This paper clarifies how boundary geometry influences flow fields and characterizes its effects on near-boundary layer flow. We construct a class of multi-scale approximate solutions based on the boundary's geometric features and establish their convergence in the L^{\\infty} framework. Our findings do not require a small-amplitude assumption, only an upper bound on the Gaussian curvature of the boundary surface. Notably, when the boundary is planar, our approach aligns with existing studies. Additionally, in the vanishing-viscosity limit, we derive a limiting-state system dependent on boundary geometric parameters. These contributions extend the theoretical understanding of boundary-layer interactions to general curved geometries and have possible applications in atmospheric, oceanic, and other geophysical flow contexts.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental open problem in the theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is whether regular spherically symmetric flows can develop singularities -- such as cavitation or implosion -- in finite time. A formidable challenge lies in how the well-known coordinate singularity at the origin can be overcome to control the lower or upper bound of the density. For the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with constant viscosity coefficients, recent striking results have shown that such implosions do indeed occur. In this paper, we show that the situation is fundamentally different when the viscosity coefficients are degenerately density-dependent (as in the shallow water equations). We prove that, for general large spherically symmetric initial data with bounded positive density, solutions remain globally regular and cannot undergo cavitation or implosion in two and three spatial dimensions. Our results hold for all adiabatic exponents $\u03b3\\in (1,\\infty)$ in two dimensions, and for physical adiabatic exponents $\u03b3\\in (1, 3)$ in three dimensions, without any restriction on the size of the initial data. To achieve these results, we make carefully designed weighted radial estimates via a region segmentation method, which is the key for obtaining uniform control over both the density and the effective velocity. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear partial differential equations involving similar difficulties.",

Numerous nonparametric estimators have been proposed, but they are all asymptotically normal with the same asymptotic variance under similar conditions, leaving little guidance for practitioners to choose an estimator. In this paper, I focus on another important perspective of their asymptotic behaviors beyond asymptotic normality, the convergence of the Wald-confidence interval (CI) coverage to the nominal coverage. Such results have been established for simpler estimators (e.g., the Berry-Esseen Theorem), but are lacking for nonparametric estimators. I consider a simple but practical setting where the AIPW estimator based on a black-box nuisance estimator, with or without cross-fitting, is used to estimate the average treatment effect in randomized controlled trials. I derive non-asymptotic Berry-Esseen-type bounds on the difference between Wald-CI coverage and the nominal coverage. I also analyze the bias of variance estimators, showing that the cross-fit variance estimator might overestimate while the non-cross-fit variance estimator might underestimate, which might explain why cross-fitting has been empirically observed to improve Wald-CI coverage.",

In addition, we provide conditions that ensure convergence of the system to a constant steady state (pointwise), outside the region of observation. Technically, we extensively use Laplace transform arguments to achieve these results.",

We introduce a deterministic geometric criterion that selects, for each branch index $n$, the correct conjugate series, thereby eliminating heuristic search and guaranteeing branch continuity across $|x|=R$. Key finding: Only the principal branch ($n=0$) remains continuous when the parameters $a$, $b$, and $x$ vary smoothly. This includes the critical limits $a\\to0$ (transition to an exponential equation) and $b\\to0$ (transition to a binomial root), where the principal branch converges to the corresponding classical solution. In contrast, branches with $n\\neq0$ exhibit oscillatory divergence as $a\\to0$ and lose their identity in these limits. This structural continuity singles out the principal branch for applications where parameters may vary with the system's state, such as in nonlinear media with field-dependent exponents or adaptive dynamical systems.",

    "abstract": "In 1995, Kazhikhov and Vaigant introduced a particular class of isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable viscosity coefficients and, for the first time, established the existence of global smooth solutions for arbitrarily large initial data in bounded two-dimensional domains. This result was subsequently extended and refined to accommodate more general constraints on the viscosity coefficients. However, because the proofs in this line of work [17,14,15,8] rely heavily on the structure of the isentropic equations, they could not be generalized to the broader setting of multidimensional compressible heat-conductive Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems. In this paper, we consider a special class of non-isentropic compressible fluids governed by the two-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with variable entropy. In this system, the pressure depends nonlinearly on both density and entropy, and the entropy evolves solely through a transport equation-a feature that distinguishes it from the standard Navier-Stokes-Fourier model. We establish, for the first time, the global existence of strong solutions for arbitrarily large initial data on both two-dimensional periodic domains and bounded domains endowed with Navier-slip boundary conditions. For the bounded-domain case, a key step in our analysis is the derivation of new commutator estimates compatible with the slip condition. Our results hold even when the initial density may contain vacuum and require no smallness assumption on the initial data, provided the shear viscosity is constant and the bulk viscosity follows a power-law form $\u03bb(\u03c1)=\u03c1^\u03b2$ with $\u03b2> 4/3$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the density remains uniformly bounded for all time. Consequently, the solution converges to an equilibrium state as time tends to infinity.",

    "abstract": "Most intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided indoor visible light communication (VLC) studies ignore the time delays introduced by reflected paths, even though these delays are inherent in practical wideband systems. In this work, we adopt a realistic assumption of IRS-induced time delay for physical layer security (PLS) enhancement. We consider an indoor VLC system where an IRS is used to shape the channel so that the reflected signals add constructively at the legitimate user and create intersymbol interference at eavesdroppers located inside the coverage area. The resulting secrecy capacity maximisation over the IRS element allocation is formulated as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem and is solved using deep reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimisation (PPO). The approach is evaluated for both colluding eavesdroppers, which combine their received signals, and non-colluding eavesdroppers, which act independently. Simulation results are shown for various simulation setups, which demonstrate significant secrecy capacity gains. In a worst-case scenario, where the eavesdroppers have stronger channels than the legitimate user, the proposed PPO-based IRS allocation improves secrecy capacity by 107\\% and 235\\% in the colluding and non-colluding cases, respectively, compared with allocating all IRS elements to the legitimate user. These results demonstrate that time-delay-based IRS control can provide a strong secrecy advantage in practical indoor VLC scenarios.",

This results in a new definition of the Brakke flow, as that of a space-time measure which satisfies the Brakke inequality in a distributional sense. Each such space-time measure corresponds to a class of equivalent (classical) Brakke flows, thus yielding an equivalence between the classical definitions of the Brakke flow, and this new definition.

To address this gap, we introduce a novel methodology that enables the transformation of any optimization problem with a known solution into an equivalent MDO problem. This equivalence holds for a large class of coupling functions, including non-linear ones. The proposed methodology exploits a ''link function'' that effectively eliminates the coupling variables from the MDO problem, without influencing the solution. This approach allows for the creation of benchmark problems with reference solutions, facilitating the comparison and evaluation of various MDO algorithms. Moreover, it is adaptable to scalable optimization problems, where the dimensions of the search and constraint spaces can be configured. We also present a variant tailored to linear coupling functions with constant coefficients sampled independently at random, for which we derive a closed-form solution to the coupling equations. For the sake of illustration, we put our approach into action on a multidimensional Rosenbrock problem, varying the number of disciplines and design variable sizes. This example showcases the versatility and applicability of our methodology in generating benchmark problems for MDO.",

    "abstract": "We consider interacting agent systems with a large number of stochastic agents (or particles) influenced by a fixed number of external stochastic lead agents. Such examples arise, for example in models of opinion dynamics, where a small number of leaders (influencers) can steer the behaviour of a large population of followers. In this context, we study a partial mean-field limit where the number of followers tends to infinity, while the number of leaders stays constant. The partial mean-field limit dynamics is then given by a McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the followers, coupled to a controlled It\u00f4-SDE governing the dynamics of the lead agents. For a given cost functional that the lead agents seek to minimise, we show that the unique optimal control of the finite agent system convergences to the optimal control of the limiting system. This establishes that the low-dimensional control of the partial (mean-field) system provides an effective approximation for controlling the high-dimensional finite agent system. In addition, we propose a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that can efficiently approximate the mean-field control. Our theoretical results are illustrated on opinion dynamics model with lead agents, where the control objective is to drive the followers to reach consensus in finite time.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a novel characterization of law-invariant and coherent risk measures, based on a generalized optimal transport problem in which the second marginal of the admissible plans is not fixed, but required to lie within a target set of probability measures. One of the main contributions of this work is a general representation formula for such risk measures, which is closely related to Kusuoka's theorem. When the aforementioned target set is convex, our representation result allows for the systematic derivation of general duality formulas. To illustrate our findings, we explicitly compute the target sets associated with several classical law-invariant coherent risk measures, including the prototypical conditional value at risk and higher moment measures.",

    "title": "Polyhedra of Constant Gaussian Curvature",
    "abstract": "Topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in the study of surfaces, though their interaction manifests differently in smooth and discrete settings. In the smooth category, a classical result asserts that any closed smooth surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant Gaussian curvature must be a sphere, reflecting the strong rigidity of differential geometry. In contrast, the discrete setting, where curvature is represented as an angular defect concentrated at vertices, admits far greater flexibility. For instance, a flat torus can be realised as a polyhedral surface in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with zero curvature at every vertex. We establish a general result: any closed surface, whether orientable or non-orientable and of arbitrary genus, can be realised in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as a (possibly self-intersecting) polyhedral surface in which every vertex has the same angular defect. This highlights a fundamental distinction between discrete and smooth settings, showing that curvature constraints in the discrete realm impose fewer restrictions. Our proof is constructive and, once recognised, entirely elementary. Yet this fundamental fact appears to have gone unnoticed in the existing literature.",

    "abstract": "We present a functional calculus treatment of Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) between Gaussian measures on separable Hilbert spaces, providing a unified framework that handles infinite-dimensional degeneracy. By leveraging the notion of proper alignment and the Schur complement, we reveal that the Gaussian EOT solution operates as a precise \\textit{spectral shrinkage}: the optimal coupling is uniquely determined by contracting the spectrum of the correlation operator via a universal scalar function. This geometric insight facilitates an algorithmic shift from iterative fixed-point schemes (e.g., Sinkhorn) to direct algebraic computation, enabling efficient multi-scale analysis, where a single spectral decomposition allows for the exact evaluation of entropic costs across arbitrary regularization parameters $\\varepsilon > 0$ at negligible additional cost. Furthermore, we investigate the asymptotic behavior as $\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0$ in settings where the unregularized Optimal Transport problem admits non-unique solutions. We establish a selection principle that the regularized limit converges to the most diffusive optimal coupling --characterized as the centroid of the convex set of optimal Kantorovich plans. This demonstrates that in degenerate regimes, the entropic limit systematically rejects deterministic Monge solutions (extremal points) in favor of the optimal solution with minimal Hilbert-Schmidt correlation, effectively filtering out spurious correlations in the null space. Finally, we derive stability bounds and convergence rates, recovering established parametric rates ($\\varepsilon \\log(1/\\varepsilon)$) in finite dimensions while identifying distinct non-parametric rates dependent on spectral decay in infinite-dimensional settings.",

The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman.

Simplified L2S-MLSE combines computational simplification and reduced state in L2S-MLSE. L2S-MLSE with a parallel sliding block architecture reduces latency from linear order to logarithmic order. Computational simplification reduces the number of multipliers from exponential order to linear order. Incorporating the reduced state with computational simplification further decreases the number of adders and comparators. The simplified L2S-MLSE is evaluated in a 112-Gbit/s PAM4 transmission over 2-km standard single-mode fiber. Experimental results show that the simplified L2S-MLSE significantly outperforms the FFE-only case in bit error ratio (BER) performance. Compared with simplified 1-step MLSE, the latency of simplified L2S-MLSE is reduced from 34 delay units in linear order to 7 delay units in logarithmic order. The simplified scheme in L2S-MLSE reduces the number of variable multipliers from 512 in exponential order to 33 in linear order without BER performance deterioration, while reducing the number of adders and comparators to 37.2% and 8.4%, respectively, with nearly identical BER performance.",

In contrast to energy-based arguments in the literature, a novel approach in the analysis considers the discrete dual norm of the residual as a computable measure for the linearization error. As a consequence, this paper provides the first convergence analysis with optimal rates of an adaptive iteratively linearized FEM beyond energy-minimization problems. The presented theory applies to strongly monotone operators with locally Lipschitz continuous Fr\u00e9chet derivative. We present a class of semilinear PDEs fitting into this framework and provide numerical experiments to underline the theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "Consider a Markov chain $(X_i)_{i\\ge0}$ with invariant measure $\u03bc$ that admits the representation $X_{i+1}=\u03a6(X_i,U_i)$, where $(U_i)_{i\\ge0}$ are i.i.d. random variables and $\u03a6$ is a measurable map. We introduce a tangent-decoupled process $(\\widetilde X_i)_{i\\ge0}$ obtained by replacing $(U_i)$ with an independent copy. Conditional on the realized backbone $(X_i)$, the sequence $(f(\\widetilde X_i))$ is independent. Although $(\\widetilde X_i)$ is not Markovian, under the same ergodicity assumptions that ensure a law of large numbers for $(X_i)$, the empirical averages $n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n f(\\widetilde X_i)$ converge almost surely to $\u03bc(f)$. In addition, for every $f\\in L^2(\u03bc)$ and every $N\\ge1$, $$ \\operatorname{Var}\\!\\Bigl(\\sum_{i=1}^N f(X_i)\\Bigr) \\;\\le\\; 2\\,\\operatorname{Var}\\!\\Bigl(\\sum_{i=1}^N f(\\widetilde X_i)\\Bigr), $$ and therefore $\u03c3_f^2 \\le 2\\,\\widetilde\u03c3_f^{\\,2}$ for the corresponding time-average variance constants. The inequality requires neither reversibility nor mixing assumptions. Its proof identifies the two sequences as tangent in the sense of decoupling theory and applies the sharp $L^2$ tangent decoupling inequality of de la Pe\u00f1a, Yao, and Alemayehu (2025).",

As the coefficients are allowed to be non-coercive, our framework encompasses a much broader scope than variational settings. To replace coercivity, we require only well-posedness of the stochastic evolution equation and two concrete, verifiable a priori estimates. Furthermore, we accommodate drift nonlinearities satisfying a modified criticality condition, and we allow for vanishing drift perturbations. The latter permits the inclusion of It\u00f4--Stratonovich correction terms, enabling the treatment of both noise interpretations. In another paper, our results have been applied to the 3D primitive equations with full transport noise. In the current paper, we give an application to a reaction-diffusion system which lacks coercivity, further demonstrating the versatility of the framework. Finally, we show that even in the coercive case, we obtain new LDP results for equations with critical nonlinearities that rely on our modified criticality condition, including the stochastic 2D Allen--Cahn equation in the weak setting.",

    "abstract": "We consider the gravitational Euler-Poisson system with a linear equation of state on an expanding cosmological model of the Universe. The expansion of the spatial sections introduces an additional dissipating effect in the Euler equation. We prescribe the expansion rate of space by a scale factor $a(t)=t^\u03b1$ with $\u03b1\\in(0,1)$, which describes the growth of length scales over time. This model is regularly applied in cosmology to study classical fluids in an expanding Universe. We study the behaviour of solutions to this system arising from small, near-homogeneous initial data and discover a \\emph{critical} change of behaviour near the expansion rate $\u03b1=2/3$, which corresponds to the matter-dominated regime in cosmology. In particular, we prove that for $\u03b1>2/3$ the fluid variables are global in time and remain small provided they are sufficiently small in a suitable norm initially. In the complementary regime $\u03b1\\leq2/3$, we present numerical evidence for shock formation of solutions to the Euler equation for arbitrarily small initial data. In combination, this establishes the existence of a critical stability threshold for barotropic fluids in expanding domains. In contrast to our previous work on the corresponding relativistic system, the threshold in the classical system considered here is independent of the speed of sound of the fluid. This establishes that fluids in cosmology behave fundamentally different in the non-relativistic regime than in the relativistic one.",

    "abstract": "When analysing extreme values, two alternative statistical approaches have historically been held in contention: the seminal block maxima method (or annual maxima method, spurred by hydrological applications) and the peaks-over-threshold. Clamoured amongst statisticians as wasteful of potentially informative data, the block maxima method gradually fell into disfavour whilst peaks-over-threshold-based methodologies were ushered to the centre stage of extreme value statistics. This paper proposes a hybrid method which reconciles these two hitherto disconnected approaches. Appealing in its simplicity, our main result introduces a new universal limiting characterisation of extremes that eschews the customary requirement of a sufficiently large block size for the plausible block maxima-fit to an extreme value distribution. We advocate that inference should be drawn solely on larger block maxima, from which practice the mainstream peaks-over-threshold methodology coalesces. The asymptotic properties of the promised hybrid-Hill estimator herald more than its efficiency, but rather that a fully-fledged unified semi-parametric stream of statistics for extreme values is viable. A finite sample simulation study demonstrates that a reduced-bias off-shoot of the hybrid-Hill estimator fares exceptionally well against the incumbent maximum likelihood estimation that relies on a numerical fit to the entire sample of block maxima.",

Within this framework, we accommodate spectral initializations under minimal assumptions on the empirical noise spectrum. In the rectangular setting, where a single rank-one component typically generates multiple informative outliers, we further propose a procedure for combining these outliers under mild non-Gaussian signal assumptions. For general RI noise models, the predicted performance of the proposed optimal OAMP algorithm agrees with replica-symmetric predictions for the associated Bayes-optimal estimator, and we conjecture that it is statistically optimal within a broad class of iterative estimation methods.",

In this paper, we introduce a parallelization construction for welded link diagrams and show that it is well defined: if two diagrams represent equivalent welded links, then the corresponding parallel diagrams obtained by our construction are also equivalent. When the two parallel strands are given parallel orientations, the resulting diagram admits a checkerboard coloring, whereas if they are assigned opposite orientations, the diagram is almost classical. Our construction further yields a decomposition in which one component is a copy of the original diagram and the other is a diagram representing a trivial welded link. We also investigate quandle colorings and the fundamental quandle of the parallel diagram, deriving a presentation from that of the original diagram.

    "title": "On Factoring and Power Divisor Problems via Rank-3 Lattices and the Second Vector",
    "abstract": "We propose a deterministic algorithm based on Coppersmith's method that employs a rank-3 lattice to address factoring-related problems. An interesting aspect of our approach is that we utilize the second vector in the LLL-reduced basis to avoid trivial collisions in the Baby-step Giant-step method, rather than the shortest vector as is commonly used in the literature. Our results are as follows:\n  1. Compared to the result by Harvey and Hittmeir (Math. Comp. 91 (2022), 1367 - 1379), who achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/5) log^(16/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5)) for factoring a semiprime N = pq, we demonstrate that in the balanced p and q case, the complexity can be improved to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N / (log log N)^(3/5) ).\n  2. For factoring sums and differences of powers, that is, numbers of the form N = a^n plus or minus b^n, we improve Hittmeir's result (Math. Comp. 86 (2017), 2947 - 2954) from O( N^(1/4) log^(3/2) N ) to O( N^(1/5) log^(13/5) N ).\n  3. For the problem of finding r-power divisors, that is, finding all integers p such that p^r divides N, Harvey and Hittmeir (Proceedings of ANTS XV, Research in Number Theory 8 (2022), no. 4, Paper No. 94) recently directly applied Coppersmith's method and achieved a complexity of O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(10+epsilon) N / r^3 ). By using faster LLL-type algorithms and sieving on small primes, we improve their result to O( N^(1/(4r)) log^(7+3 epsilon) N / ((log log N minus log(4r)) r^(2+epsilon)) ). The worst-case running time for their algorithm occurs when N = p^r q with q on the order of N^(1/2). By focusing on this case and employing our rank-3 lattice approach, we achieve a complexity of O( r^(1/4) N^(1/(4r)) log^(5/2) N ).\n  In conclusion, we offer a new perspective on these problems, which we hope will provide further insights.",

The group $K$ acts on the flag variety $G/B$ with finitely many orbits and Brion has derived a general formula for the cohomology classes of the corresponding orbit closures as linear combinations of Schubert classes. This article provide a uniform description of the sets of Weyl group elements (which we refer to as Brion atoms) indexing the terms in this formula. This builds on prior work addressing types A, B, and C. The main novelty of our results is a thorough treatment of type D. As one application, we introduce a notion of involution Schubert polynomials for all classical types and present several conjectures related to these objects.",

As frequently happens in stochastic regimes, we consider the problem of finding a zero of the sum of two operators, where one is either unavailable in closed form or computationally expensive to evaluate, and shall therefore be approximated using a finite number of noisy oracle samples. Under the lens of algorithmic stability, we then derive probabilistic bounds on the distance between a true zero and the FB output without making specific assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We show that under weaker conditions ensuring the convergence of FB schemes, stability bounds grow proportionally to the number of iterations. Conversely, stronger assumptions yield stability guarantees that are independent of the iteration count. We then specialize our results to a popular FB stochastic Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm and validate our theoretical bounds on a control problem for smart grids, where the energy price uncertainty is approximated by means of historical data.",

    "title": "Explicit and Non-asymptotic Query Complexities of Rank-Based Zeroth-order Algorithm on Stochastic Smooth Functions",
    "abstract": "Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization with ordinal feedback has emerged as a fundamental problem in modern machine learning systems, particularly in human-in-the-loop settings such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference learning, and evolutionary strategies. While rank-based ZO algorithms enjoy strong empirical success and robustness properties, their theoretical understanding, especially under stochastic objectives and standard smoothness assumptions, remains limited. In this paper, we study rank-based zeroth-order optimization for stochastic functions where only ordinal feedback of the stochastic function is available. We propose a simple and computationally efficient rank-based ZO algorithm. Under standard assumptions including smoothness, strong convexity, and bounded second moments of stochastic gradients, we establish explicit non-asymptotic query complexity bounds for both convex and nonconvex objectives. Notably, our results match the best-known query complexities of value-based ZO algorithms, demonstrating that ordinal information alone is sufficient for optimal query efficiency in stochastic settings. Our analysis departs from existing drift-based and information-geometric techniques, offering new tools for the study of rank-based optimization under noise. These findings narrow the gap between theory and practice and provide a principled foundation for optimization driven by human preferences.",

    "abstract": "We study a variant of cost-aware sequential hypothesis testing in which a single active Decision Maker (DM) selects actions with positive, random costs to identify the true hypothesis under an average error constraint, while minimizing the expected total cost. The DM may abort an in-progress action, yielding no sample, by truncating its realized cost at a smaller, tunable deterministic limit, which we term a per-action deadline. We analyze how this cancellation option can be exploited under two cost-revelation models: ex-post, where the cost is revealed only after the sample is obtained, and ex-ante, where the cost accrues before sample acquisition.\n  In the ex-post model, per-action deadlines do not affect the expected total cost, and the cost-error tradeoffs coincide with the baseline obtained by replacing deterministic costs with cost means. In the ex-ante model, we show how per-action deadlines inflate the expected number of times actions are applied, and that the resulting expected total cost can be reduced to the constant-cost setting by introducing an effective per-action cost. We characterize when deadlines are beneficial and study several families in detail.",

    "title": "The global structure of locally chordal graphs",
    "abstract": "A graph is locally chordal if each of its small-radius balls is chordal. In an earlier work [AKK25], the authors and Kobler proved that locally chordal graphs can be characterized by having chordal local covers, by forbidding short cycles and wheels as induced subgraphs, and by the property that each of their minimal local separators is a clique. In this paper, we address the global structure of locally chordal graphs. The global structure of chordal graphs is given by the following characterizations: a graph is chordal if and only if it is the intersection graph of subtrees of a tree, if and only if it admits a tree-decomposition into cliques. We prove a local analog of this characterization, which essentially says that a graph is locally chordal if and only if it is the intersection graph of special subtrees of a high-girth graph, if and only if it admits a special graph-decomposition over a high-girth graph into cliques. We also prove that these global representations of locally chordal graphs can be efficiently computed.\n  This paper has two major contributions. The first is to exhibit for locally chordal graphs an ideal \"local to global\" analysis: given a graph class defined by restricted local structure, we fully describe the global structure of graphs in the class. The second is to develop the theory of graph-decompositions. Much of the work in this paper is devoted to properties of graph-decompositions that represent the global structure of graphs. This theory will be useful to find global decompositions for graph classes beyond locally chordal graphs.",

As an application of this build-up, band limited frames are generated in the context of Lie groups which are homogeneous in nature with polynomial volume growth, complete Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded from below and admits the volume doubling property, together with other settings.

For instance, membership in these spaces is typically required for transport maps in optimal transport theory and for stochastic processes in probability theory. Nonlinear Lebesgue spaces also arise naturally in applications such as medical imaging, where the physical signals at play often exhibit little regularity and take their values in nonlinear spaces. Yet, these spaces remain little studied in the literature, likely due to their lack of differential structure outside the case where mappings are valued in a linear space. This paper is the first in a series by the authors devoted to the study of geometric and analytic properties of nonlinear Lebesgue spaces. The present article exposes a systematic treatment of their measure-theoretic properties, unifying and refining scattered results from the literature while also extending classical results from the linear setting to this broader nonlinear framework -- including the characterizations of their completeness and their separability as well as the density of some of their subspaces: the spaces of simple, continuous and smooth mappings.",

    "abstract": "An energy-based modeling framework for the nonlinear dynamics of spatial Cosserat rods undergoing large displacements and rotations is proposed. The mixed formulation features independent displacement, velocity and stress variables and is further objective and locking-free. Finite rotations are represented using a director formulation that avoids singularities and yields a constant mass matrix. This results in an infinite-dimensional nonlinear port-Hamiltonian (PH) system governed by partial differential-algebraic equations with a quadratic energy functional. Using a time-differentiated compliance form of the stress-strain relations allows for the imposition of kinematic constraints, such as inextensibility or shear-rigidity. A structure-preserving finite element discretization leads to a finite-dimensional system with PH structure, thus facilitating the design of an energy-momentum consistent integration scheme. Dissipative material behavior (via the generalized-Maxwell model) and non-standard actuation approaches (via pneumatic chambers or tendons) integrate naturally into the framework. As illustrated by selected numerical examples, the present framework establishes a new approach to energy-momentum consistent formulations in computational mechanics involving finite rotations.",

    "abstract": "We present a Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for sharp-interface two-phase diffusion problems in static geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework.",

In the massless case, the limiting dynamics propagate ballistically with constant speed, while in the massive case the velocity is relativistic. Our analysis justifies the emergence of relativistic Vlasov equations from Dirac--Hartree dynamics in the semiclassical regime.

Representing the uncertainty by a large number of scenarios guarantees accurate results but challenges the solution process. One way to overcome this is by using scenario reduction methods, which aim at finding a distribution supported on fewer scenarios, but leading to similar optimal first-stage decisions. In this paper, we recap the classical scenario reduction theory based on the distance of probability distributions and the optimal mass transportation problem. We then review and compare various formulations of the underlying cost function of the latter used in the literature. Using the Forward Selection Algorithm, we show that a specific formulation of the cost function can be proven to select the best possible scenario from a given sample on the first draw with respect to the Relative Approximation Error. We demonstrate this result and compare the quality of the approximation as well as the computational performance of the different cost functions using a modified version of the IEEE RTS 24-Bus System. In many cases, we find that the optimal solution of the two-stage stochastic unit commitment problem with 200 scenarios can be approximated with around 2% scenarios when using this cost function.",

    "abstract": "There are three universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras $\\mathcal{W}_{\\infty}$, $\\mathcal{W}^{\\text{ev}}_{\\infty}$, and $\\mathcal{W}^{\\mathfrak{sp}}_{\\infty}$ which are freely generated of types $\\mathcal{W}(2,3,4,\\dots)$, $\\mathcal{W}(2,4,6,\\dots)$, and $\\mathcal{W}(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4,\\dots)$, respectively. They serve as classifying objects for vertex algebras with these generating types satisfying mild hypotheses. Their $1$-parameter quotients are expected to be the building blocks of all $\\mathcal{W}$-algebras of classical Lie types. Furthermore, such $\\mathcal{W}$-algebras are expected to be organized into families that are governed by new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras, which are themselves glueings of copies of $\\mathcal{W}_{\\infty}$ in type $A$ (together with a Heisenberg algebra), and copies of $\\mathcal{W}^{\\text{ev}}_{\\infty}$ and $\\mathcal{W}^{\\mathfrak{sp}}_{\\infty}$ in types $B$, $C$, and $D$. We denote these universal objects by $\\mathcal{W}^{X,S,M}_{\\infty}$, where $X$ denotes the Lie type (either $A$, $C$, or $BD$ since types $B$ and $D$ can be treated uniformly), and $S$, $M$ are sets of positive integers that determine certain families of partitions. More precisely, for a partition $P = (n_0^{m_0}, n_1^{m_1},\\dots, n_{t}^{m_t})$ of $N = \\sum_{i=0}^t n_i m_i$ consisting of $m_i$ parts of size $n_i$, where $n_0> n_1 > \\cdots > n_t \\geq 2$, $M = \\{m_0,\\dots, m_t\\}$ is the set of multiplicities, and $S = \\{d_1,\\dots, d_t\\}$ is the set of height differences $d_{i+1} = n_i - n_{i+1}$. After introducing this general conjectural picture, we will construct the first nontrivial example $\\mathcal{W}^{\\mathfrak{so}_2}_{\\infty}:=\\mathcal{W}^{BD, \\emptyset, \\{2\\}}_{\\infty}$, which is a glueing of two copies of $\\mathcal{W}^{\\text{ev}}_{\\infty}$.",

Firstly, we show that if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are 3-free products of cyclics of rank $\\ge 3$ then $G$ is also a 3-free product of cyclics. Secondly, we prove that if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are 4-free products of cyclics of rank $\\ge 4$ then every 4-generated subgroup of $G$ is a free product of $\\le 4$ cyclics or a 1-relator quotient of a free product of four cyclic groups. Here a group is called an $n$-free product of cyclics if every $n$-generated subgroup is a free product of $\\le n$ cyclic groups. These results are based on ubiquitous applications of the Nielsen method for amalgamated free products which we recall carefully.\n  Lastly, given an infinite, finitely presented group which is not free, but all of its infinite index subgroups are free, a well-known conjecture says that it is isomorphic to a surface group. We revisit and elaborate on predominantly group theoretic proofs of this conjecture for cyclically amalgamated products as above, as well as for certain HNN extensions.",

    "title": "Static size-effects meet the dynamic scattering properties of finite-sized mechanical metamaterials: a relaxed micromorphic study with parameter identification via two-stage static-dynamic optimization",
    "abstract": "Mechanical metamaterials exhibit size-effects when a few unit-cells are subjected to static loading because no clear micro-macro scale separation holds and the characteristic length of the deformation becomes comparable to the unit-cell size. These size-effects typically manifest themselves as a strengthening of the response in a form summarized as \"smaller is stiffer\". Moreover, the dynamical behavior of mechanical metamaterials is very remarkable, featuring unique phenomena such as dispersive behavior and band-gaps where elastic waves cannot propagate over specific frequency ranges. In these frequency ranges, the wavelength becomes gradually comparable to the unit-cell size, giving rise to microstructure related phenomena which become particularly visible in the reflection/transmission patterns where an incident wave hits the metamaterial's interfaces. This raises the question of whether the static size-effects and dynamic reflection/transmission patterns are correlated.\n  In this work, we investigate the interaction of the static size-effects and the dynamic scattering response of mechanical metamaterials by employing the relaxed micromorphic model. We introduce a two-stage optimization procedure to identify the material parameters. In the first stage, the static material parameters are identified by exploiting the static size-effects through a least squares fitting procedure based on the total energy. The dynamic parameters are determined in the second stage by fitting the dispersion curves of the relaxed micromorphic model to those of the fully discretized microstructure. At this second stage, we assess the results obtained by fitting the dispersion curves in one and in two propagation directions, for both the relaxed micromorphic model (RMM) with curvature and its reduced counterpart (RRMM) without curvature.\n  The full abstract is presented in the paper.",

Global-in-time existence and convergence of a weak solution to the auxiliary problem are proved, and local-in-time existence and convergence of a unique strong solution are established.

In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\\int_\u03a3\\mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $\u03a3$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\\mathcal{A}^{\\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $\u03a3$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action.",

    "title": "Convergence analysis for non-iterative sequential schemes for Biot's model",
    "abstract": "An alternative to the fully implicit or monolithic methods used for the solution of the coupling of fluid flow and deformation in porous media is a sequential approach in which the fully coupled system is broken into subproblems (flow and mechanics problems) that are solved one after the other. This fully explicit coupling approach is a very simple scheme which allows much flexibility in the implementation and has a lower computational cost, making it quite attractive in practice since smaller linear systems need to be solved in order to obtain the solution for the whole coupled poroelastic system. Due to the appealing advantages of these methods, intensive research is currently being carried out in this direction, as in the present work. Although the application of this type of method is very common in practice, there exist only a few works devoted to their theoretical analysis. In this work, we consider the so-called explicit fixed-stress split scheme, which consists of solving the flow problem first with time-lagging the displacement term, followed by the solution of the mechanics problem. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first convergence analysis of the explicit fixed-stress split scheme for Biot's equations. In particular, we prove that this algorithm is optimally convergent if the considered finite element discretization satisfies an inf-sup condition. In addition, with the aim of designing the simplest scheme for solving Biot's model, we also propose a similar decoupled algorithm for piecewise linear finite elements for both variables which arises from the novel stabilization recently proposed in \\cite{Pe2025}, and is demonstrated to be optimally convergent.",

    "abstract": "The {\\em Prym} of a cyclic covering of smooth projective curves is the ``new'' part of the Jacobian: the quotient of the Jacobian of the covering curve by the Jacobians of the intermediate covers. Given a family of such coverings, the fundamental group of the base of the family acts on the Tate modules of the Pryms, and the image of this representation is a key ingredient in answering arithmetic statistics questions about the distribution of the group structure of the $L$-torsion of a random Prym in the family. (Over ${\\mathbb{F}}_q$, the action of Frobenius is roughly uniformly distributed over the {\\em arithmetic} monodromy, a coset of the image of the fundamental group of the base change to $\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q$ (the {\\em geometric} monodromy).) In the present note, we show for a number of natural families that (with limited exceptions) the geometric monodromy is sandwiched between a certain unitary group and its derived subgroup. In particular, this holds for the one-parameter families obtained by starting with any fixed cover and varying one (tame) ramification point. As an application, we deduce analogous largeness results for the monodromy of the Selmer groups of elliptic surfaces with $j=0$ or $j=1728$, by relating them to cyclic covers of degree 6 or 4 respectively, implying that their Selmer groups do not satisfy the standard heuristics. For instance, for eliptic surfaces with $j=0$ of sufficiently large height over ${\\mathbb{P}}^1_{\\mathbb{F}_q}$, the average size of the $l$-Selmer group is $l+3+o_q(1)$ when $l$ (fixed) and $q$ (large) are both 1 mod 3, compared to $l+1+o_q(1)$ for general elliptic surfaces.",

    "abstract": "We fully characterize the mappings $\u03a6$ that send every Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve to a PH curve. We prove that in any dimension, such mappings are precisely the conformal functions whose dilation is the square of a real rational function. In the planar case, this implies (up to conjugation) that $\\partial\u03a6/\\partial z = \u03a8^{2}$, where $\u03a8$ is meromorphic and satisfies $\\operatorname{Res}(\u03a8^{2}) = 0$ at every pole. In higher dimensions, PH preservation forces $\u03a6$ to be a conformal map; for $n \\ge 3$, Liouville's theorem then implies that any local diffeomorphism with this property is (anti-)M\u00f6bius. These results subsume the previously known ``(scaled) PH-preserving'' constructions of mappings $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ and align with Ueda's conformal viewpoint on isothermal and spherical geometries. At the level of examples, we demonstrate how PH-preserving mappings relate to the construction of rational PH curves and minimal surfaces.",

We establish a compactness theory modular three types of bubbles. As applications, we get some quantization results for several important topological number associated with the vector bundles, for instance, the first Pontrjagin numbers $p_1(E)$ of vector bundles over Einstein 4-manifolds and the Euler numbers $\u03c7(M;E)$ of holomorphic vector bundles over K\u00e4hler-Einstein surfaces. Furthermore, we get some quantization results about the volume $v(L_j)$ and certain cohomological numbers (e.g. $dim H^0(M_j;L_j)$) of holomorphic line bundles $L_j$ over non-collapsed degenerating K\u00e4hler-Einstein surfaces $(M_j,J_j,g_j)$ with the aid of the classical vanishing theorems, the classical Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch type theorems, and the profound convergence theory of K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we obtain some interesting identities involving non-collapsed degenerating compact K\u00e4hler-Einstein surfaces with non-zero scalar curvature, which indicate that we can know the Euler number of $M_j$ for large $j$ provided some topological information of the limit orbifold $M_\\infty$. For K\u00e4hler-Einstein Del Pezzo surfaces, an interesting implication is that we can provide some preliminary estimates for the number of singularities of various types in $M_\\infty$ in an effective way. As an unexpected surprise, we find an identity which connects Milnor numbers for singularities in $M_\\infty$ and the correction terms in the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem for orbifolds.

The spatial discretization is based on a high-order Polytopal Discontinuous Galerkin (PolyDG) method, coupled with the Crank-Nicolson time discretization scheme with explicit extrapolation of the ion term. To improve solver efficiency, we consider additive Schwarz preconditioners within the PolyDG framework, which combines (massively parallel) local subdomain solvers with a coarse-grid correction. Numerical experiments demonstrate robustness with respect to the discretization parameters, as well as a significant reduction in iteration counts compared to the unpreconditioned solver. These features make the proposed approach well-suited for parallel large-scale simulations in brain electrophysiology.",
