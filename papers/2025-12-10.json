    "title": "On the Fundamental Tradeoff of Joint Communication and QCD: The Monostatic Case",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the fundamental tradeoff between communication and quickest change detection (QCD) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems under a monostatic setup. We introduce a novel Joint Communication and quickest Change subblock coding Strategy (JCCS) that leverages feedback to adapt coding dynamically based on real-time state estimation. The achievable rate-delay region is characterized using state-dependent mutual information and KL divergence, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing the interplay between communication performance and detection delay. Moreover, we provide a partial converse demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of the proposed detection algorithm within the JCCS framework. To illustrate the practical implications, we analyze binary and MIMO Gaussian channels, revealing insights into achieving optimal tradeoffs in ISAC system design.",

    "abstract": "We explore applications of the celebrated construction of the Milnor connecting homomorphism from the odd to the even K-groups in the context of Hopf--Galois theory. For a finitely generated projective module associated to any piecewise cleft principal comodule algebra, we provide an explicit formula computing the clutching $K_1$-class in terms of the representation matrix defining the module. Thus, the module is determined by an explicit Milnor idempotent. We apply this new tool to the K-theory of quantum complex projective planes to determine their $K_0$-generators in terms of modules associated to noncommutative Hopf fibrations. On the other hand, using explicit homotopy between unitaries, we express the $K_0$-class of the Milnor idempotents in terms of elementary projections in the Toeplitz C*-algebra. This allows us to infer that all our generators are in the positive cone of the $K_0$-group, which is a purely quantum phenomenon absent in the classical case.",

Under properness on bounded sets and a nonzero local index at the given base solution, each branch satisfies the following alternative: either it is unbounded, or it reaches the boundary of the domain, or it accumulates at a different solution on the base parameter level. When the component is bounded and stays in the interior, there is a degree balance on the base slice entailing a vanishing sum of local indices and, in particular, the existence of an even number of non-degenerate contact points. For real-analytic maps we construct locally injective parameterizations that exhibit blow-up, approach to the boundary, or return to the base level. An application to a quasilinear boundary value problem driven by the mean-curvature and Minkowski operators illustrates the global results.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a fundamental characterization of the discrete ambiguity functions (AFs) of random communication waveforms under arbitrary orthonormal modulation with random constellation symbols, which serve as a key metric for evaluating the delay-Doppler sensing performance in future ISAC applications. A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations. Finally, four representative waveforms, namely, SC, OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM, are examined under both frameworks, and all theoretical results are verified through numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "The dissertation focuses on decomposing a group algebra $kG$ over a field of positive characteristic into a direct sum of projective indecomposable modules. Such a decomposition is obtained together with the Artin--Wedderburn Theorem. The main goal of the dissertation is to explicitly decompose given group algebras as a direct sum of their projective indecomposable modules.\n  To achieve this, we determine the radical series of each projective indecomposable module of the given group algebras. For a group algebra over characteristic $p$, each projective indecomposable module has a simple head that is isomorphic to its socle. Projective covers and injective envelopes are used to construct these modules. A cyclic group algebra is uniserial, and a $p$-group algebra over characteristic $p$ is itself a projective indecomposable module. Using these properties, we explicitly find all projective indecomposable modules for the following group algebras over characteristic $2$: the Klein four-group, the alternating group $A_4$, and the alternating group $A_5$. Their relationships play an important role in this process.\n  Since $p$-group algebras have trivial head and trivial socle, the Klein four-group algebra has a corresponding radical series. Its decomposition into a direct sum of projective indecomposable modules is described explicitly, and the Cartan matrix of a group algebra is obtained by calculating the multiplicities of simples in its projective indecomposable modules.\n  The topic is then extended slightly by considering the unique decomposition of a group algebra into a direct sum of particular modules known as blocks. For $kA_4$, the primitive orthogonal idempotents are calculated, and since $kA_4$ has one block, it is equal to its block decomposition. For $kA_5$, we show that there are two blocks, determined by checking the nonzero entries in its Cartan matrix.",

While beliefs must be proper probability distributions that integrate to one, messages may have infinite integral values. In Gaussian-projected EP, such messages take a Gaussian form and appear as if they have \"negative\" variances. Although allowed within the EP framework, these negative-variance messages can impede algorithmic progress.\n  In this paper, we investigate EP in linear models and analyze the relationship between the corresponding beliefs. Based on the analysis, we propose both non-persistent and persistent approaches that prevent the algorithm from being blocked by messages with infinite integral values.\n  Furthermore, by examining the relationship between the EP messages in linear models, we develop an additional approach that avoids the occurrence of messages with infinite integral values.",

We illustrate the approach in intraday trading where the agent charges or discharges a battery over a finite number of delivery periods, and the electricity prices are subject to bid-ask spreads and significant uncertainty. Optimal strategies are found in a matter of minutes on a regular PC.

The game is over as soon as Painter manages to achieve a monochromatic copy of $H$. For sufficiently large $n$, we consider the smallest number $f(n, H)$ of edges so that Painter can always win after $f(n, H)$ edges have been exposed by Builder.

    "abstract": "List recovery of error-correcting codes has emerged as a fundamental notion with broad applications across coding theory and theoretical computer science. Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) and univariate multiplicity codes are explicit constructions which can be efficiently list-recovered up to capacity, namely a fraction of errors approaching $1-R$ where $R$ is the code rate.\n  Chen and Zhang and related works showed that folded Reed-Solomon codes and linear codes must have list sizes exponential in $1/\u03b5$ for list-recovering from an error-fraction $1-R-\u03b5$. These results suggest that one cannot list-recover FRS codes in time that is also polynomial in $1/\u03b5$. In contrast to such limitations, we show, extending algorithmic advances of Ashvinkumar, Habib, and Srivastava for list decoding, that even if the lists in the case of list-recovery are large, they are highly structured. In particular, we can output a compact description of a set of size only $\\ell^{O((\\log \\ell)/\u03b5)}$ which contains the relevant list, while running in time only polynomial in $1/\u03b5$ (the previously known compact description due to Guruswami and Wang had size $\\approx n^{\\ell/\u03b5}$). We also improve on the state-of-the-art algorithmic results for the task of list-recovery.",

Implicit coupling introduces non-local terms, whereas explicit coupling results in only conditionally stable schemes. Furthermore, incorporating inertial effects alongside viscous resistance enlarges the parameter space, making calibration more difficult.\n  In this work, we propose a new type of boundary condition based on the method of asymptotic partial decomposition of a domain (MAPDD), which we denote as the Duct Boundary Condition (DuBC). This approach enables the incorporation of geometrically reduced domains as a boundary term with only local coupling in the implicit case. Moreover, the DuBC accounts for both viscous and inertial effects simultaneously using a single physical parameter. Additionally, we derive a fractional-step time-marching scheme including the DuBC. We demonstrate the features of the DuBC in coronary artery blood flow simulations, including sequential parameter estimation from noisy velocity data.",

However, the theoretical understanding of various reinforcement learning algorithms needs further exploration to enhance their efficiency and safety. In this article, by means of primal-dual optimization tools, we study the partially model-free design of the mean-field stochastic LQR (MF-SLQR) controller using a policy learning approach. Firstly, by designing appropriate optimizing variables, the considered MF-SLQR problem is transformed into a new static nonconvex constrained optimization problem with equivalence preserved in certain senses. After that, the equivalent formulation of the duality results is constructed via finding the solution of the generalized Lyapunov equation. Then, the strong duality is analyzed, based on which we establish a primal-dual algorithm by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. More importantly, a partially model-free implementation is also presented, which has a direct connection with the classical policy iteration algorithm. Finally, we use a high-dimensional example to validate our methods.",

    "title": "Adaptive Matched Filtering for Sensing With Communication Signals in Cluttered Environments",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the performance of the adaptive matched filtering (AMF) in cluttered environments, particularly when operating with superimposed signals. Since the instantaneous signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) is a random variable dependent on the data payload, using it directly as a design objective poses severe practical challenges, such as prohibitive computational burdens and signaling overhead. To address this, we propose shifting the optimization objective from an instantaneous to a statistical metric, which focuses on maximizing the average SCNR over all possible payloads. Due to its analytical intractability, we leverage tools from random matrix theory (RMT) to derive an asymptotic approximation for the average SCNR, which remains accurate even in moderate-dimensional regimes. A key finding from our theoretical analysis is that, for a fixed modulation basis, the PSK achieves a superior average SCNR compared to QAM and the pure Gaussian constellation. Furthermore, for any given constellation, the OFDM achieves a higher average SCNR than SC and AFDM. Then, we propose two pilot design schemes to enhance system performance: a Data-Payload-Dependent (DPD) scheme and a Data-Payload-Independent (DPI) scheme. The DPD approach maximizes the instantaneous SCNR for each transmission. Conversely, the DPI scheme optimizes the average SCNR, offering a flexible trade-off between sensing performance and implementation complexity. Then, we develop two dedicated optimization algorithms for DPD and DPI schemes. In particular, for the DPD problem, we employ fractional optimization and the KKT conditions to derive a closed-form solution. For the DPI problem, we adopt a manifold optimization approach to handle the inherent rank-one constraint efficiently. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

For finite $n$, the associated Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto $\u03c3$-forms are $\\PIV$ (GUE), $\\mathrm{PV}$ (LUE), and $\\PVI$ (JUE); under soft- or hard-edge scalings these degenerate to $\\PII$ or $\\PIIIp$ descriptions of the Tracy-Widom and hard-edge laws \\cite{tracy1994level,forrester2003painleve,deift1999orthogonal}.\n  It is well known among random matrix theorists (for example Folkmar Bornemann) that the Fredholm determinant is a more numerically stable and accurate way to compute the CDF of the largest eigenvalue for GUE, LUE, JUE than direct Painlev\u00e9 integration. The aim of this paper is not to improve on Fredholm methods, but to see to what extent one can numerically recover the \\emph{correct} Painlev\u00e9 solution from finite-$n$ data and how unstable this reconstruction is. Numerically, we verify the equality between the Fredholm- and Painlev\u00e9-based CDFs by combining (a) high-accuracy Nystr\u00f6m discretizations of the finite-$n$ Fredholm determinants \\cite{bornemann2010numerical} with (b) an anchored, branch-locked integration of the $\u03c3$-form ODEs, where anchors are extracted from local least-squares fits to $\\log\\det(I-\\mathsf K)$.

In each case, we show that the treatment effects have well-defined limits as the population size diverges to infinity. Additionally, we develop polynomial time algorithms to consistently evaluate the treatment effects in each case. Finally, we estimate the unknown parameters from the observed data using maximum pseudo-likelihood estimates, and establish the stability of our causal effect estimators under this perturbation. Our algorithms provably approximate the causal effects in polynomial time even in low-temperature regimes where the canonical MCMC samplers are slow mixing.

We begin by proving that for both the real and complex fields, the space $C(K)$ admits an infinite-dimensional SPR subspace if and only if the second Cantor-Bendixson derivative $K{''}$ is nonempty. We then show how to construct ``large\" SPR subspaces of $C(K)$, where the size of the subspace depends quantitatively on the number of non-trivial Cantor-Bendixson derivatives that the compact Hausdorff space $K$ possesses.",

They appear to be the most natural choice for the spectral theory of digraphs. Undirected graphs have adjacency spectrum symmetric about 0 if and only if they are bipartite. The situation is more complex for the Hermitian spectra of digraphs. In this paper we study non-bipartite oriented graphs with symmetric Hermitian spectra. Our main result concerns the extremal problem of maximizing the density of spectrally symmetric oriented graphs. The maximum possible density is shown to be between 13/18} and 10/11. Furthermore, we give a necessary condition for an oriented graph to be spectrally symmetric based on the adjacency spectrum of the underlying graph. This allows us to show that line graphs of sufficiently dense graphs do not admit spectrally symmetric orientations. We also show how to construct infinite families of spectrally symmetric graphs using 1-sums.",

Our approach relies on the natural Lagrangian change of coordinates and a detailed analysis of the linearized problem (the Stokes system) in the maximal regularity regime, formulated in the Lebesgue spaces $L_p(0,T; L_q)$, including time-weighted variants. The main difficulty lies in the treatment of boundary terms, for which we apply a new technique based on complex interpolation to control nonlinear terms in fractional Sobolev spaces. This strategy also allows us to handle the case of variable density, which is not easily addressed by approaches based on Besov spaces.\n  Using this framework and real interpolation techniques, we construct also solutions in the Lorentz class $L_{p,1}(0,T; L_q)$ in time. The method further enables a rigorous study of the stability of equilibrium configurations. In particular, we resolve the problem in two spatial dimensions, where the interplay between geometry and regularity is especially subtle. Beyond these specific applications, the proposed approach provides a powerful tool for broader classes of nonlinear PDEs and further developments in maximal regularity theory.",

The aim of the study is to introduce and analyze a generalized family of mixed exponential statistical structures and their corresponding linear positive operators, which include known operators as particular cases. We define auxiliary statistical structures B and H through differential relations between their elements, and construct the main Phillips-type structure. Recurrent relations for the central moments are obtained, their properties are established, and the convergence and approximation accuracy of the constructed operators are investigated. The proposed approach allows mixed exponential structures to be viewed as a generalization of known statistical systems, providing a unified analytical and stochastic description. The results demonstrate that mixed exponential statistical structures can be used to develop new classes of positive operators with controllable preservation and approximation properties. The proposed methodology forms a basis for further research in constructing multidimensional statistical structures, analyzing operators in weighted spaces, and studying their asymptotic characteristics.",

It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and facilitates classification tasks, especially in the small data regime, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology. Here, a typical issue is that the given data may be subject to affine transformations caused by the measuring process. To make the R-CDT invariant under arbitrary affine transformations, a two-step normalization of the R-CDT has been proposed in our earlier works. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a family of generalized normalizations to enhance flexibility for applications. Second, we study multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean settings by making use of generalized Radon transforms. We prove that our novel feature representations are invariant under certain transformations and allow for linear separation in feature space. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments based on 2d images, 3d shapes and 3d rotation matrices, showing near perfect classification accuracies and clustering results.",

We regard these categories as a family over an affine space, introduce a stratification on this parameter space, and formulate conjectures on the structural constancy of fibers on each stratum. Using the theory of $\\mathfrak{sl}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$-categorification, we prove these conjectures for admissible strata. Namely, we axiomatize the notion of multi-Fock tensor product categorifications (MFTPCs), which are interval finite highest weight categories equipped with a compatible action of commuting copies of $\\mathfrak{sl}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$, categorifying an external tensor product of tensor products of highest and lowest weight Fock space representations. We prove a uniqueness theorem for admissible MFTPCs and show that complex rank parabolic categories O have the structure of MFTPCs. In turn, for suitable choices of parameters, we produce an equivalence of complex rank category O with a stable limit of classical parabolic categories O, resolving our conjecture in the admissible case. These equivalences yield multiplicities of simple objects in Verma modules in terms of stable parabolic Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, answering a question posed by Etingof. In particular, for the case of two Levi blocks of non-integral size, we completely describe the structure of the corresponding category O in terms of stable representation theory. As an application, we obtain multiplicities for parabolic analogs of hyperalgebra Verma modules introduced by Haboush in the large rank and large characteristic limit.",

    "title": "A multivariate generalization of Hall's theorem for Edgeworth expansions of bootstrap distributions",
    "abstract": "Theorem 5.1 in the monograph by Hall (1992) provides rigorous in-probability justification of Edgeworth expansions of bootstrap distributions. Proving this result was rather challenging because bootstrap distributions do not satisfy the classical Cram\u00e9r condition and therefore classical methods for justifying Edgeworth expansions, e.g. Bhattacharya and Rao (1976) and Bhattacharya and Ghosh (1978), are not available. Hall's (1992) theorem is for a univariate statistic which can be expressed as a smooth function of means, though the underlying population can be multivariate. However, there are a number of applications where a multivariate version of Hall's theorem is needed, and generalizing the proof from the univariate case to the multivariate case is not immediate. Our primary purpose in this article is to fill this gap by stating a multivariate version of the theorem and sketching the modifications to the proof of Hall's (1992) Theorem 5.1 that are needed.",

    "abstract": "This paper primarily investigates the geometric properties of excursions of L\u00e9vy processes reflected at the past infimum with long lifetime or large height. For an oscillating process in the domain of attraction of a stable law, our results state that excursions with a long lifetime need not have a large height. After a suitable scaling, they behave like stable excursions with lifetime or height greater than one. These extend the related results in Doney and Rivero [Prob. Theory Relat. Fields, 157(1) (2013) 1-45]. In contrast, for the negative-drift case we prove that under a heavy-tailed condition, long lifetime and large height are asymptotically equivalent. Conditioned on either event, excursions converge under spatial scaling to a single-jump process with Pareto-distributed jump size and size-biased jump time. Moreover, after a suitable time rescaling, the effect of the negative drift becomes apparent.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal polynomials of a continuous variable in the Askey scheme satisfying second order difference equations, such as the Askey-Wilson polynomial, can be studied by the quantum mechanical formulation, idQM (discrete quantum mechanics with pure imaginary shifts). These idQM systems have the shape invariance property, which relates the Hilbert space $\\mathsf{H}_\u03bb$ ($\u03bb$ : a set of parameters) and that with shifted parameters $\\mathsf{H}_{\u03bb+\u03b4}$ ($\u03b4$ : shift of $\u03bb$), and gives the forward and backward shift relations for the orthogonal polynomials. Based on the forward shift relation and the Christoffel's theorem with some polynomial $\\check\u03a6(x)$, which is expressed in terms of the quantities appeared in the forward and backward shift relations, we obtain some difference relations for the orthogonal polynomials. The multiplication of $\\sqrt{\\check\u03a6(x)}$ gives a surjective map from $\\mathsf{H}_{\u03bb+2\u03b4}$ to $\\mathsf{H}_\u03bb$.

We characterize their Smith forms over $\\mathbb{K}[y]$ in terms of the dual spaces of differential operators, that were defined and studied by H. M. M\u00f6ller et al. In particular, we show that, if the leading coefficients of $f$ and $g$ are coprime over $\\mathbb{K}[y]$, then the partial multiplicities of the Sylvester and B\u00e9zout resultant matrices coincide with certain integers, that we call M\u00f6ller indices.

We prove that this placement probability is always equal to $1/4$ plus a rational function, whose shape depends on the location of the domino, multiplied by a position-independent factor that involves only the size of the diamond. This result leads to significantly more compact explicit counting formulas compared to previous findings. As a direct application, we derive explicit counting formulas for the domino tilings of Aztec diamonds with $2\\times 2$-square holes at arbitrary positions.",

As a result, LRPOP can solve low-rank polynomial optimization problems that are far beyond the reach of existing sparse hierarchies. In particular, we solve problems with up to thousands of variables with total degree in the thousands. Numerical conditioning for problems of this size is improved by using the Bernstein basis.

The size of the particles, their distance between each other and the layer's thickness are all of the same order but small compared to the wavelength of the incident wave. Solving the Helmholtz equation in this context can be very costly and the simulation depends on the given distribution of particles. To circumvent this, we propose, via a multi-scale asymptotic expansion of the solution, an effective model where the layer of particles is replaced by an equivalent boundary condition. The coefficients that appear in this equivalent boundary condition depend on the solutions to corrector problems of Laplace type defined on unbounded random domains. Under the assumption that the particles are distributed given a stationary and mixing random point process, we prove that those problems admit a unique solution in the proper space. We then establish quantitative error estimates for the effec tive model and present numerical simulations that illustrate our theoretical results.",

We establish a fundamental property for these families, proving the existence of a polynomial with a desired degree whose smallest root is greater than or equal to the smallest root of the expected polynomial. Applying this framework to the generalized CUR matrix approximation problem, we derive a theoretical upper bound on the spectral norm of a residual matrix, expressed in terms of the largest root of the expected polynomial. We then explore two important special cases: the classical CUR matrix decompositions and the row subset selection problem. For classical CUR matrix decompositions, we derive an explicit upper bound for the largest root of the expected polynomial. This yields a tighter spectral norm error bound for the residual matrix compared to many existing results. Furthermore, we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving the classical CUR problem under certain matrix conditions. For the row subset selection problem, we establish the first known spectral norm error bound. This paper extends the applicability of interlacing families and deepens the theoretical foundations of CUR matrix decompositions and related approximation problems.",

    "title": "Lie Theory Theorems over Positive Characteristic and Modular Lie algebras",
    "abstract": "Sometimes, it is very important to consider what type of setting is assumed when studying a mathematical object. For example, in Galois theory, properties can completely change if we study a field extension over $F_p$ instead of a field over $\\mathbb{Q}$. When we consider base fields for modules, algebras, or vector spaces, we often recall commonly used fields such as $\\mathbb{C}$ and fields $F$ with char $F= p$.\n  Similar behavior arises in the study of Lie algebras. Properties that hold for Lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero do not necessarily hold over a field of characteristic $p$. In general, we are more familiar with studying Lie algebras and their representations over $\\mathbb{C}$. However, an interesting fact is that new properties can be discovered by studying the theory over fields of positive characteristic.\n  Therefore, we will closely examine how theorems and properties in Lie algebra theory do not hold or behave differently when the base field has characteristic p. In fact, there is a related area of study known as modular Lie theory that deals specifically with this setting. In this theory, we study concepts such as the definition of restricted Lie algebras, that is, Lie algebras $L$ equipped with a p-mapping $[p] : L \\rightarrow L$, defined as $x\\mapsto x^{[p]}$, where the base field has prime characteristic. In other words, the theory introduces a new tool, the $p$-mapping, for the study of modular Lie algebras.\n  In this project, we aim to study Lie algebras defined over fields of positive characteristic. Specifically, the main focus will be on how Lie algebras behave over such fields and how we can develop the general framework of modular Lie theory based on the insights and structures that arise in this setting.",

Although the classical $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \\in (1,\\infty)$, the gap between known upper and lower bounds remains substantial, in particular for small $p \\ge 1$. To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \\emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights.\n  Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds. For $p=2$ these bounds are explicit and optimal; for general $p \\in [1,\\infty)$ we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates. The improvement can be interpreted as a form of importance sampling for the underlying Sobolev space $F_{d,q}$.\n  Our results also reveal that, even with optimal densities, the curse of dimensionality persists for random points when $p\\ge 1$, and it becomes most pronounced for small $p$. This suggests that the curse should also hold for the classical $L_1$-discrepancy for deterministic point sets.",

Drawing inspiration from the notion of a normalized (or variational) Nash equilibrium, which is a more restrictive class of solutions to generalized Nash games, we extend the ideas of Harwood et al.

In particular we will advance the study of spectral architectures with new results on convergence rates highlighting the role of the smoothness in the training data set, and a study of adversarial robustness.

We first characterise sub-game--perfect Nash equilibria and the corresponding value processes of all players through a system of coupled backward stochastic differential equations. We then analyse the mean-field counterpart and its sub-game--perfect mean-field equilibria, described by a system of McKean-Vlasov backward stochastic differential equations.

The utilization of a Fourier-based direct solver facilitates the attainment of flexibility and enhanced performance by accommodating any combination of unbounded and semi-unbounded boundary conditions. The employment of high-order compact stencils contributes to the reduction of communication demands while concurrently enhancing the accuracy of the system.

Unlike standard Lagrangian methods, which are prone to mesh distortion, this framework computes fluid deformations in a fixed reference configuration and systematically maps them to the physical domain via the Piola-Kirchhoff stress. Further, the structure preserving design ensures that the discrete analogues of the fundamental conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy are satisfied up to machine precision.

To justify use of SMD, one should be reasonably confident that the group-level variances are equal. Empirical evidence often contradicts this assumption. Thus, we have investigated an alternate approach, based on stochastic ordering of the treatment and control distributions, that takes into account means and variances. For applying stochastic ordering, our development yields a key quantity, $\\mathsf{A}$, the outcome value at which the direction of the ordering of the treatment and control distributions changes.\n  Using an extensive simulation, we studied relative bias of point estimators of $\\mathsf{A}$ and coverage and relative width of bootstrap confidence intervals.",

    "abstract": "Techniques from metric geometry have become fundamental tools in modern mathematical data science, providing principled methods for comparing datasets modeled as finite metric spaces. Two of the central tools in this area are the Gromov-Hausdorff distance and persistent homology, both of which yield isometry-invariant notions of distance between datasets. However, these frameworks do not account for categorical labels, which are intrinsic to many real-world datasets, such as labeled images, pre-clustered data, and semantically segmented shapes. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for labeled metric spaces and develop new notions of Gromov-Hausdorff distance and persistent homology which are adapted to this setting. Our main result shows that our persistent homology construction is stable with respect to our novel notion of Gromov-Hausdorff distance, extending a classic result in topological data analysis. To facilitate computation, we also introduce a labeled version of persistence landscapes and show that the landscape map is Lipschitz.",

    "abstract": "The Kirchhoff plate model plays a vital role in modeling, computing and analyzing the mechanical behaviors of thin plate structures. This study propose a novel fourth-order multi-scale (FOMS) computational method for high-accuracy and efficient simulation of composite Kirchhoff plates with highly periodic heterogeneities. At first, two-scale asymptotic expansion theory is employed to establish the high-accuracy fourth-order multi-scale computation model with novel fourth-order correctors for composite Kirchhoff plates, which are governed by fourth-order partial differential equation (PDE) with periodically oscillatory and highly discontinuous coefficients. Then, the locally point-wise error analysis is derived to theoretically illustrate the local balance preserving of fourth-order multi-scale model enabling high-accuracy multi-scale computation. Furthermore, a global error estimation with an explicit order for fourth-order multi-scale solutions is first demonstrated under appropriate assumptions. In contrast to the second- and third-order multi-scale solutions, only the fourth-order one is capable of providing an explicit error order estimate. Additionally, an efficient numerical algorithm is developed to conduct high-accuracy simulation for heterogeneous plate structures. Extensive numerical examples are provided to confirm the theoretical results for the computational convergence and accuracy of the proposed method. This work offers a higher-order (fourth-order) multi-scale computational framework that enables robust simulation and high-accuracy analysis to composite Kirchhoff plates.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm to deal with these disadvantages. Our method can be implemented with various Hessian approximations, including methods that use only the first-order information. Thus, computational costs might be drastically reduced. Also, it can be adjusted to problems' geometries via the usage of different Bregman divergences. The proposed method converges for nonconvex and convex problems globally and it has the same rates as other well-known methods that lack mentioned properties.

We consider an enhanced primary control layer including droop control and autonomous limitation of power and energy. We prove that this enables the use of constant power setpoints to achieve optimal operation under certain conditions. In order to relax these conditions, the approach is combined with an energy management system, which solves a robust unit commitment problem within a model predictive control framework.

In this setting, the bootstrap philosophy, originating in the S-matrix program and revived in modern conformal bootstrap theory, reappears as a rigorous analytic tool for extracting spectral data from consistency alone, without solving the model explicitly.\n  We explain how Schwinger-Dyson equations, factorization at large $N$, and the noncommutative moment problem lead to finite-dimensional semidefinite programs whose feasible regions encode the allowed pairs of coupling constants and moments. Connections with spectral geometry, in particular the study of Laplace eigenvalues, are also discussed, illustrating how bootstrapping provides a unified mechanism for deriving bounds in both commutative and noncommutative settings.",

Examples with $k>1$ include degree-Rips bifiltrations and models of the multicover bifiltration. We consider the problem of converting a $k$-critical bifiltration into a $1$-critical (i.e. free) chain complex with equivalent homology. This is known as computing a free resolution of the underlying chain complex and is a first step toward post-processing such bifiltrations.\n  We present two algorithms. The first one computes free resolutions corresponding to path graphs and assembles them to a chain complex by computing additional maps. The simple combinatorial structure of path graphs leads to good performance in practice, as demonstrated by extensive experiments. However, its worst-case bound is quadratic in the input size because long paths might yield dense boundary matrices in the output. Our second algorithm replaces the simplex-wise path graphs with ones that maintain short paths which leads to almost linear runtime and output size.\n  We demonstrate that pre-computing a free resolution speeds up the task of computing a minimal presentation of the homology of a $k$-critical bifiltration in a fixed dimension. Furthermore, our findings show that a chain complex that is minimal in terms of generators can be asymptotically larger than the non-minimal output complex of our second algorithm in terms of description size.",

In this paper, we develop a purely combinatorial framework for mutation of infinite quivers, independent of but compatible with these topological constructions. By formalizing infinite quivers as limits of embedded finite quivers, we establish a consistent definition of mutation that generalizes prior surface-based results. We then apply this framework to extend the notion of reddening sequences, special mutation sequences with significant algebraic consequences, from the finite to the infinite setting.

The key input is a generalization of a bound on the rank of flat vector bundles by Landesman and Litt, which we apply to the isomonodromy foliation on the relative de Rham space.

    "abstract": "Multigrid methods have been a popular approach for solving linear systems arising from the discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) for several decades. They are particularly effective for accelerating convergence rates with optimal complexity in terms of both time and space. K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid is a robust variant of the multigrid method that combines the efficiency of multigrid with the robustness of Krylov-type residual minimalizations for problems with strong anisotropies. However, traditional implementations of K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid often rely on bulk-synchronous parallelism, which can limit scalability on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This paper presents a task-parallel variant of the K-cycle orthonormalization multigrid method that leverages asynchronous execution to improve scalability and performance on large-scale parallel systems.",

Under ergodic assumptions ensuring the applicability of the fractional averaging and fractional homogenization theorems of Hairer and Li (arXiv:1902.11251, arXiv:2109.06948), we establish a fluctuation result. The deviation of the slow motion, scaled by epsilon^{1/2-H}, from its effective, time-dependent random limit converges, as the time-separation scale epsilon tends to zero, to the solution of a stochastic differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion and influenced by an additional space--time Gaussian field. Since the averaging principle and the fractional homogenization hold in different modes of convergence, obtaining the required joint convergence is a delicate matter. Moreover, neither the continuity of the Ito--Lyons solution map nor the martingale method is directly applicable for our purposes, so the proof requires several innovations. To establish the fluctuation theorem, we combine cumulant methods with a residue lemma and formulate the enlarged system as a rough differential equation in a suitable space.",

We provide precise asymptotics for this phenomenon, which is an echo of non-quasilocality happening in higher dimensions. Second, we turn to the one-sided point of view and prove that the TBF is a g-measure in the sense of dynamical systems and ergodic theory. The corresponding g-function is quasilocal but becomes long-range again for large $p$. From that we finally develop our third view, in which we provide a transparent construction of the process in terms of a driving Markov chain on the integers of generalized house of cards type, offering a novel perspective on the TBF.",

An infinite subfamily of Paley triple arrays turns out to be resolvable.\n  We also introduce a new intermediate object, unordered triple arrays, that are to triple arrays what symmetric 2-designs are to Youden rectangles, and propose a strengthening of Agrawal's long-standing conjecture on the existence of extremal triple arrays. For small parameters, we completely enumerate all unordered triple arrays, and use this data to corroborate the new conjecture.

Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \\textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \\times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure.",

The model describes a compressible, viscous quantum fluid with Korteweg type capillarity effects, and allows for degenerate viscosity and vacuum regions.\n  The construction proceeds in two main steps. First, it is introduced a Faedo Galerkin approximation endowed with suitable damping mechanisms, which yields smooth approximate solutions through compactness arguments.

    "abstract": "Compact Runge-Kutta (cRK) Flux Reconstruction (FR) methods are a variant of RKFR methods for hyperbolic conservation laws with a compact stencil including only immediate neighboring finite elements. We extend cRKFR methods to handle hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms and non-conservative products. To handle stiff source terms, we use IMplicit EXplicit (IMEX) time integration schemes such that the implicitness is local to each solution point, and thus does not increase inter-element communication. Although non-conservative products do not correspond to a physical flux, we formulate the scheme using numerical fluxes at element interfaces. We use similar numerical fluxes for a lower order finite volume scheme on subcells of each element, which is then blended with the high order cRKFR scheme to obtain a robust scheme for problems with non-smooth solutions. Combined with a flux limiter at the element interfaces, the subcell based blending scheme preserves the physical admissibility of the solution, e.g., positivity of density and pressure for compressible Euler equations. The procedure thus leads to an admissibility preserving IMEX cRKFR scheme for hyperbolic equations with stiff source terms and non-conservative products. The capability of the scheme to handle stiff terms is shown through numerical tests involving Burgers' equations, reactive Euler's equations, and the ten moment problem. The non-conservative treatment is tested using variable advection equations, shear shallow water equations, the GLM-MHD, and the multi-ion MHD equations.",

We exploit this representation to construct new families of maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes over finite and infinite fields, and over division rings. These constructions generalize many of the known existing constructions of MSRD codes as well as of optimal codes in the rank and in the Hamming metric.

On a set of 112 benchmark instances, consisting of up to 1,000 locations and 1,000 customers, computational results show that PaKS consistently outperforms both a standard KS implementation and the current state-of-the-art heuristic for solving the SSCFLP, as well as CPLEX when run with a time limit. For these instances, PaKS achieved an average gap compared to the best known solution of 0.02%. Experimental results conducted on a large set of new very large test problems, comprising up to 2,000 locations and 2,000 customers, demonstrate that PaKS outperforms both the standard KS heuristic and CPLEX in terms of quality of the solution found, finding the largest number of best solutions, and achieving the smallest average gap.",

The resulting model constitutes a strongly coupled, cross-diffusion hybrid system of differential equations. The primary mathematical challenges arise from the strongly coupled cross-diffusion terms, the parabolic operators of divergence form, and the interaction between the cross-diffusion fluxes and the ODE components. We address these by deriving several a priori estimates for dimensions d less or equal to 3. Subsequently, we employ a decoupling strategy to split the system into proper sub-problems, establishing the existence (and uniqueness) for each subsystem.

The equations are formulated for components of the Maxwell field relative to the algebraically special frame of Kerr, with the unknowns treated as tensorial quantities associated with a non-integrable horizontal distribution. The extremal Maxwell components decouple into Teukolsky equations, whereas the middle Maxwell components form a coupled system of transport and elliptic equations. Assuming control over the extremal components, we prove uniform boundedness (without loss of derivatives) and decay estimates for the middle components in the full |a|<=M range of spacetime parameters. Our analysis relies on (i) deriving a decoupled system of transport and elliptic equations for two modified middle Maxwell components and (ii) decomposing general solutions into a dynamical and stationary part, the latter determined by two real (electric and magnetic) charges which are entirely read off from the initial data at the event horizon.\n  In the sub-extremal |a|<M case, works of Shlapentokh-Rothman and the second author provide the necessary control over the extremal components, yielding unconditional boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations.\n  In the extremal |a|=M case, we formulate a conjectural boundedness and decay statement for the extremal components, motivated by work of Casals, Gralla and Zimmerman on fixed azimuthal mode solutions compactly supported away from the event horizon. Our boundedness and decay results for all the unknowns in the equations remain, therefore, conditional. We show that the complicated dynamics of the extremal components at the event horizon is inherited by the middle components; in particular, we uncover novel conservation laws for the middle components of axisymmetric solutions.",

The model introduced here will specifiy aggregate output as determined by aggregate supply of capital and education investment. After formulating and analysing such a model in section 2 we will consider the effectiveness of education for the growth of the National Product. It turns out that small changes of the quality of education has a considerable impact on economic growth. Secondly we consider the influence of chaotic fluctuations of capital investments caused by hype-cycles or erratic policies. In section 3 we introduce a continuous control on education investments depending on consumption. In this 3-dimensional macro-economic model it turns out that a tipping point exists where increase of consumption affecting the amount of education and innovation leads to decline of economic growth.",

    "title": "Realization of relational presheaves",
    "abstract": "Relational presheaves generalize traditional presheaves by going to the category of sets and relations (as opposed to sets and functions) and by allowing functors which are lax. This added generality is useful because it intuitively allows one to encode situations where we have representables without boundaries or with multiple boundaries at once. In particular, the relational generalization of precubical sets has natural application to modeling concurrency. In this article, we study categories of relational presheaves, and construct realization functors for those. We begin by observing that they form the category of set-based models of a cartesian theory, which implies in particular that they are locally finitely presentable categories. By using general results from categorical logic, we then show that the realization of such presheaves in a cocomplete category is a model of the theory in the opposite category, which allows characterizing situations in which we have a realization functor. Finally, we explain that our work has applications in the semantics of concurrency theory. The realization namely allows one to compare syntactic constructions on relational presheaves and geometric ones. Thanks to it, we are able to provide a syntactic counterpart of the blowup operation, which was recently introduced by Haucourt on directed geometric semantics, as way of turning a directed space into a manifold.",

    "abstract": "We continue the development of the theory of higher dimensional walks on ordinals began recently by Bergfalk. In particular we identify natural coherence conditions on higher dimensional $C$-sequences that entail coherence of the resultant higher rho-functions. We also introduce various higher square principles by adding non-triviality conditions to these coherent higher $C$-sequences and investigate basic properties of said square principles. For example, in analogy with the classical case, we prove that these higher square principles abound in the constructible universe but can be forced to fail, modulo large cardinals. Finally, we prove that certain higher rho-functions obtained by walking along higher square sequences exhibit non-triviality in addition to coherence. In particular, it follows that higher square principles on a cardinal $\u03bb$ entail certain non-vanishing \u010cech cohomology groups for $\u03bb$ considered with the order topology.",

This provides a way to construct new Frobenius nonclassical curves, which are curves that tend to have many $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points. We also prove that a certain type of Frobenius nonclassical hypersurfaces $\\mathcal{S}$ defined by separated variables are such that their Gauss maps restricted to any curve contained in $\\mathcal{S}$ is inseparable. Finally, in parallel with the plane curve cases, we show that if the strict Gauss map $\u0393$ of a $\\mathbb{F}_q$-Frobenius nonclassical hypersurface $\\mathcal{S}$ is given by $p$ powers, then $\u0393$ is purely inseparable.",

    "abstract": "In classical factorization theory, an integral domain is called \\emph{atomic} if every nonzero nonunit element can be written as a finite product of irreducible elements. Here, we introduce and study a weaker notion of atomicity, which relaxes the requirement that all elements admit a factorization into irreducibles. Namely, we say that an integral domain is \\emph{completely atomic} if every nonunit divisor of an atomic element is also atomic. We further consider several factorization properties associated with this notion. Then, we investigate the basic properties of such domains, provide examples, and explore the behavior of the completely atomic property under standard constructions such as localization, polynomial rings, and $D+M$ constructions. Our results highlight the independence of the completely atomic property from other classical factorization properties and introduce an important class of integral domains that lies between atomic and non-atomic domains.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the dynamics of induced map $2^f$ of a given pointwise periodic homeomorphism $f:X\\to X$ of a compact metric space $X$. First, we show that the topological entropy of $2^f$ is zero, i.e. $h_{top}(2^f)=0$ and that the set of almost periodic points coincides with the set of uniformly recurrent points, i.e. $AP(2^f)=UR(2^f)$. Furthermore, we prove that inside any infinite $\u03c9$-limit set $\u03c9_{2^f}(A)$ there is a unique minimal set and this minimal set is an adding machine. As a consequence, $(2^X,2^f)$ has no Devaney chaotic subsystems. In contrast to these rigidity properties, we obtain some results with chaotic flavor. In fact, we prove the following dichotomy, the hyperspace system $(2^X,2^f)$ is either equicontinuous or choatic with respect to Li-Yorke chaos and $\u03c9$-chaos. It is shown that the later case occurs if and only if $R(2^f)\\setminus AP(2^f)\\neq\\emptyset$. This enables us to provide simple examples of pointwise periodic homeomorphisms with chaotic induced systems.",
